# Meet Katherine Oakley

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_"As someone who has tutored students both in and out of medical school for more than 5 years, I love seeing students learn and then apply effective strategies for studying and test-taking. I have found that helping students succeed and reach their academic potential is one of the most rewarding experiences imaginable. I am passionate about helping students understand difficult subjects, and I love taking topics that may seem confusing or complicated and translating them into easy-to-understand concepts. I'm so excited to work with you!"_
