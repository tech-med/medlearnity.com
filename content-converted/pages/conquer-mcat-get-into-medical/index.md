# Conquer the MCAT and Get Into Medical School

The biggest hurdle to med school admission can become your greatest opportunity to stand out.

## Do any of these sound like you?

- You’re spending long hours studying for the MCAT, but you aren’t improving on your practice tests.
- You already took the MCAT, but you were disappointed when you didn’t score as highly as you wanted.
- You’ve taken the MCAT more than once, but you hit a score plateau and you aren’t sure how to get past it.
- You experience test anxiety on high-stakes exams, and want to be able to tackle the MCAT with confidence.
- You want to use a great MCAT score to make up for some potential issues with your med school application.
- You want to achieve a spectacular MCAT score in order to get into a top-tier medical school.
- **You know that medicine is your calling, and you want to do everything you can to achieve your dream.**

## If any of the above statements sound like you, we want you to know that you’re not alone!

Thousands of students take the MCAT every year, and many of them find themselves struggling to get the score they desire. Issues like test anxiety, ineffective study strategies, and overwhelm can prevent you from getting the MCAT score that you need in order to achieve your dream of becoming a doctor.

## Medicine is a calling, but getting into medical school is a challenge.

Last year, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) [reported](https://www.aamc.org/system/files/2020-10/2020_FACTS_Table_A-16.pdf) that of 53,371 people who applied to med school, only 21,879 of them were successful. In other words, just 40% of those who apply to medical school succeed and end up matriculating as med students. It’s not likely to get any easier; applications are only increasing every year, as more people recognize the value of a career in medicine.

## The MCAT is one of the primary factors in determining who gets into med school.

Medical school admissions directors rely heavily on the MCAT to make their decisions, because it’s an objective measurement that can be easily compared across all applicants. This gives it a unique weight in your application.

The MCAT is scored on a scale from 472 to 528, with the average score being 500. The average MCAT score for those who matriculate into medical school is 511; that’s above the 80th percentile, meaning that you should be aiming to do better than 80% of students who take this test. 

If you want to become a doctor, this exam is absolutely crucial to your future.

## The good news is that your performance on the MCAT is largely under your control. 

**Your dream of being a doctor can become a reality.**

**You can experience the satisfaction and security of a career in medicine.** 

**You just need the right strategy to help you succeed.** 

## Medlearnity is here to help.

Our students report significant improvements on their MCAT scores – up to 12 to 15 points. This could easily be the difference between getting into med school and not getting in at all. It could also be the edge that gains you acceptance to your first-choice med school, and could even help you get scholarships to offset the high cost of medical education.

Bahaa is a master educator for all subjects on the MCAT.

When it comes to preparing for the MCAT, working with him is as good as it gets.

## Here is what some of Bahaa's students have said about his tutoring:

Bahaa is very knowledgeable, patient, and concise. He helped me with biology concepts I was having trouble retaining and understanding. Bahaa goes the extra mile after our session to prepare notes and questions to reinforce the topics we went over.

Bahaa helped develop key study strategies for the difficult chemistry material as well as provided numerous practice questions - both during and after tutoring sessions - to ensure success in the class.

I truly appreciate all of \[Bahaa's\] help this semester. It really made a difference in my understanding of the chemistry material. Thank you!

Bahaa has helped me look deeper into concepts than just surface level really has helped me with ways to study and memorize some concepts
