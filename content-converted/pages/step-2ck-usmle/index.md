## Scoring well on USMLE Step 2 CK bolsters your residency application, especially if your Step 1 score wasn't ideal. Even if you did do well on Step 1, a strong performance on Step 2 CK demonstrates consistency and clinical excellence.

### USMLE Step 2 CK and CS Overview

![](//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_594717740.jpg "shutterstock_594717740")

Step 2 is taken during the third or fourth year of medical school. It consists of two parts:

Step 2 CK, Clinical Knowledge and Step 2 CS, Clinical Skills.

### How is Step 2 CS Administered?

Step 2 CS is a one-day, 8-hour clinical skills exam that consists of a series of **patient encounters** in which you see standardized patients (actors) and **investigate their medical complaint**. You will have 12 patient encounters, and 15 minutes for each. Step 2 CS is graded on a pass/fail metric.

### How is Step 2 CK Administered?

Unlike Step 2 CS, **Step 2 CK is graded on a competitive numerical scale**. Step 2 CK is a one-day exam administered in one 9-hour testing session. The exam is divided into eight 60-minute blocks, with each block having a maximum of 40 questions. The total number of items on the overall exam will not exceed 318.

### What Material Does Step 2 Cover?

In contrast to [Step 1](https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-tutoring-step-1/), Step 2 CK is a more clinically-oriented exam, and **covers medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatry**. Step 2 CK tests your ability to apply medical knowledge, skills and understanding of clinical sciences to deliver patient care, health maintenance, disease prevention, diagnosis and management. **Beginning in June 2020, Step 2 CK will include an increased number of questions that test systems-based practice, patient safety, legal/ethical issues and professionalism**.

### How Important is Step 2 of the USMLE?

Step 2 CK is graded on a numerical scale and has **essentially become the new Step 1 in terms of competitive residency application metrics**. Students now allocate more time to studying material that will be important for their residency because the Step 2 results specify correctness for particular subject matter topics rather than a general pass or fail exam result. Step 2 tutors help you reach your goals for scoring correctly in your intended medical field niches.

### How is Step 2 Scored?

The minimum passing score for Step 2 CK is 209, and the national average is a 243, with a standard deviation of 16. Competitive specialties such as dermatology, neurosurgery and plastic surgery expect residency applicants to perform well on Step 2 CK. In 2022, the USMLE Step 1 is scheduled to transition to a pass/fail metric -- when that change takes place, **your Step 2 CK score, which will still be a numerical score, will be even more important for your residency application.**

## USMLE Step 2 Tutoring Reviews From Real Students

#### Dr. Goel is an amazing tutor and he will bring out the very best in anyone with whom he works. His services will be a remarkable asset to any exam preparation plan and he has the experience and results that attest to this.

I am a US medical school graduate who has a very difficult time with standardized testing. So much so that initially, I did not pass the second part of the USMLE exam (STEP 2 CK.) I found out about Dr. Goel's tutoring through a friend who used him for her USMLE test preparation. During our initial meeting, I knew he was the perfect tutor for my needs. He was able to accurately assess my strengths and weakness based on our personal interaction rather than assume what I needed according to my previous score. This was essential to the services he rendered because he quickly determined that I had a wealth of knowledge suitable for this exam but my test-taking skills were the source of my issues.

Dr. Goel created a plan that accurately and efficiently addressed the weaknesses in my testing skills. His program included optimizing the use of Anki, which is an electronic note card program, a special strategy to approach the multiple choice questions on USMLE boards, and reviewing material from common board prep question banks. He also designed a pacing system to help me stay on track with timing for each question and he would select various topics for us to discuss the pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and treatment in order to ensure comprehensive understanding of key medical presentations even beyond the board exam.

Overall, Dr. Goel's support and interest in my immediate and long term goals were exemplary. With his strategic and specific approach, I was able to pass STEP 2 CK with a score that increased by more than 30 points. The results speak for themselves! Dr. Goel is an amazing tutor and he will bring out the very best in anyone with whom he works. His services will be a remarkable asset to any exam preparation plan and he has the experience and results that attest to this. I am truly grateful that I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Goel and I enthusiastically recommend him as an integral component to your medical exam study plan!

#### I ended up passing CK with a score that I was really happy with and matched into residency.

I was having a lot of difficulties with USMLE Step 2 CK. I had reached a point where I had thought that I had peaked since my practice scores weren't improving after having already completed UWorld. They helped me with my approach to the questions and taught me methods to better retain what I was learning over longer periods of time. My tutor even helped me prioritize my learning and continued to work with me to create an adaptive study schedule that fit my lifestyle. It really improved my confidence with my knowledge which was reflected in the scores I was seeing. I ended up passing CK with a score that I was really happy with and matched into residency. I never hesitate to recommend their services to anyone I think might benefit. [Reference Link](https://g.co/kgs/YzAg2K).

#### Thanks to his guidance, my CK score was 30 points higher than my Step 1 mark! I strongly recommend Medlearnity!

I worked with my tutor for my Step 2 CK for the past 4 months. Throughout the process, he completely changed my way of approaching questions! Even though there was an adjustment period, his techniques proved to be extremely helpful and useful. He was also extremely patient and understanding throughout the entire process. His explanations of medical concepts and problems were very clear and thorough. He was also motivating with his frequent check-ins, which ensured that I gave my maximum effort on a daily basis. Thanks to his guidance, my CK score was 30 points higher than my Step 1 mark! I strongly recommend Medlearnity! [Reference Link](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/64bde837f6bc322f521a3031).
