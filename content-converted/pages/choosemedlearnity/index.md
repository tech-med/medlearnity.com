## What Makes Medlearnity Different?

We’ve listened to thousands of students and understand the common frustrations they've encountered elsewhere. That’s why Medlearnity is different in all the ways that matter:

- **Other services charge premium prices**—often $250–$350/hour—without offering trial sessions or refund flexibility.
- **Inconsistent tutoring quality** when providers rely heavily on medical students or part-time tutors without formal training.
- Limited availability and rigid scheduling models making consistent support difficult.
- **Bundled services** driving up prices for features you don’t need.
- **Impersonal support** with generic study plans that fail to address your unique learning needs.

At Medlearnity, we address these concerns directly with:

- Flexible, student-driven scheduling
- Customized study plans
- A proprietary QBank built in-house
- Transparent pricing and a low-cost trial
- Genuine commitment to your individual success

“After struggling with previous exams, I passed my COMLEX Level 3 on the first try. My tutor helped me target my weaknesses and approach questions strategically. I couldn’t have done it without Medlearnity.” – **Khadije S., DO Student**

“I’ve always had severe test anxiety. Working with Dr. Anthony transformed my approach and gave me confidence. I passed the ABIM boards—and truly learned the material. I’m incredibly grateful.” – **Silviya P., MD**
