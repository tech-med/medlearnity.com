# Meet Viemma Nwigwe

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_"In my 10 years of tutoring, the one thing that never gets old is watching the confidence of my students increase so much so that by the end of our time together, they are owning subject matters that once brought them fear and anxiety. Watching them demonstrate understanding of the material to a point where they are tackling difficult questions with minimal assistance from me will never get old. My mindset when it comes to tutoring is "by any means necessary". I will do everything in my power to help you reach your goals!"_
