## USMLE Step 3 is the final hurdle in the USMLE exam series and is often the most underestimated by aspiring doctors. Don't let your guard down just yet.

## USMLE Step 3 Overview

Here is some of the essential information you should know about the USMLE Step 3 exam. 

![](//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Health-Professional.jpg "Health-Professional")

### What Content Does USMLE Step 3 Cover?

You will typically take Step 3 during your first year of residency. **The exam tests your ability to apply medical knowledge and understanding of biomedical and clinical science that is essential to the unsupervised practice of medicine**, focusing on patient management in ambulatory settings.

### How Is USMLE Step 3 Administered?

Step 3 is a **two-day exam**. Day One has approximately seven hours in the test session, including 45 minutes of break time. There will be **232 multiple-choice items divided into six blocks**. **You get one hour to complete each block**. The first day focuses on foundations of independent practice, and tests foundational sciences, biostatistics, interpretation of medical literature, patient safety, communication and interpersonal skills and medical ethics.

**Day Two** has approximately nine hours in the test session, including a minimum of 45 minutes of break time. There will be **180 multiple-choice items, divided into six blocks of 30 items each. You get 45 minutes to complete each block**. Day Two focuses on advanced clinical medicine and tests knowledge of patient diagnosis and disease management. **Day Two includes computer-based case simulations** that test your skills in patient diagnosis and disease management, specifically highlighting your knowledge of patient history, physical examination and the use of diagnostic studies. **There will be 13 case simulations with an allotted time of 10 to 20 minutes each.**

### How Important Is Step 3 of the USMLE?

Step 3 is the final examination in the USMLE series that an aspiring doctor must pass to earn a license to practice medicine in the United States without supervision. Thus, **a solid study schedule and a passing score are just as important for Step 3 as they are for the first two exams.**

### How Is USMLE Step 3 Scored?

The minimum passing score for Step 3 is 196, and the national average is 226, with a standard deviation of 15. Step 3 is the USMLE exam that is most often underestimated by aspiring doctors. **Students who have excelled on** [**Step 1**](https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-tutoring-step-1/) **and** [**Step 2 CK**](https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/) **may have challenges with Step 3, given their busy residency schedule, the exam's unique simulation component, or a residency specialty that doesn't utilize the medicine concepts tested in Step 3**. If you are pursuing a fellowship, a strong Step 3 performance can help your application stand out.

## USMLE Step 3 Testimonials

#### I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them.

I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them. The tutoring really helped me through the daunting task of preparing for the exam, and preparing for future standardized testing as well. I was assigned a tutor for the ACM -type questions and biostats, as well as a second tutor for CCS. I also received significant, and much needed coaching from Dr. Gohel, so I actually had a team of 3 doctors helping me prep. An amazing team, sure to get even the busiest scalpel back to razor sharpness!

#### I am forever grateful for their dedication in helping me pass.

Dr. Goel and his tutors are life savers. I could not have passed my step 3 without them!!! I improved from 190 to 220. The tutors are highly qualified and really good at figuring out your strength and weakness and finding ways to overcome your weakness during the tutoring sessions. More importantly, they are always willing to work around your schedule. The tutors taught me the best strategies to tackle each questions and use effective techniques to look at the minor details which I was ignoring earlier and could not catch with my untrained eyes. Hence, I was getting a lot of the questions wrong. I was tutored for 30 hours and with each session my coannfidence and test taking strategies vastly improved. Within a month, I made a lot of improvement. I am forever grateful for their dedication in helping me pass. Dr. Geol was always a phone call or text away advising me, helping me calm my nerves before the exam. I can't thank them enough. I highly recommend them. They also offer financial aid/loan through a third party incase the money is an issue for you.

#### Through his help I went from failing USMLE Step 1 to getting my number one residency in my chosen specialty.

Akshay is not only an expert in medical knowledge, but also a master educator who knows exactly how to tailor lesson plans to maximize retention, recall, and deep understanding of complex topics. Through his help I went from failing USMLE Step 1 to getting my number one residency in my chosen specialty. If I'd have found him sooner, I would have saved many hours and hundreds of dollars wasted on less worthy educational resources that I tried, including Kaplan and Doctors in Training. Now as a resident in clinical practice, the learning habits he taught me help me excel far beyond my peers. His methodology the epitome of "high-yield" learning. If you want the easiest, most efficient and most entertaining path to medical mastery, look no further!
