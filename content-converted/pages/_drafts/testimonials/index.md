Below are completely UNFILTERED, REAL REVIEWS from REAL Students

#### Dr. Goel is an amazing tutor and he will bring out the very best in anyone with whom he works. His services will be a remarkable asset to any exam preparation plan and he has the experience and results that attest to this.

I am a US medical school graduate who has a very difficult time with standardized testing. So much so that initially, I did not pass the second part of the USMLE exam (STEP 2 CK.) I found out about Dr. Goel's tutoring through a friend who used him for her USMLE test preparation. During our initial meeting, I knew he was the perfect tutor for my needs. He was able to accurately assess my strengths and weakness based on our personal interaction rather than assume what I needed according to my previous score. This was essential to the services he rendered because he quickly determined that I had a wealth of knowledge suitable for this exam but my test-taking skills were the source of my issues.

Dr. Goel created a plan that accurately and efficiently addressed the weaknesses in my testing skills. His program included optimizing the use of Anki, which is an electronic note card program, a special strategy to approach the multiple choice questions on USMLE boards, and reviewing material from common board prep question banks. He also designed a pacing system to help me stay on track with timing for each question and he would select various topics for us to discuss the pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and treatment in order to ensure comprehensive understanding of key medical presentations even beyond the board exam.

Overall, Dr. Goel's support and interest in my immediate and long term goals were exemplary. With his strategic and specific approach, I was able to pass STEP 2 CK with a score that increased by more than 30 points. The results speak for themselves! Dr. Goel is an amazing tutor and he will bring out the very best in anyone with whom he works. His services will be a remarkable asset to any exam preparation plan and he has the experience and results that attest to this. I am truly grateful that I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Goel and I enthusiastically recommend him as an integral component to your medical exam study plan!

#### By the end of medical school, I had 38 interview invitations from Internal Medicine programs throughout the country, the highest number of interview invitations for my medical school class.

Throughout medical school, my ambitions had always been high but my test taking skills, not always the best. Working with Akshay provided a transformative experience. I had my first session with him while preparing for Step 1, and I have never looked back. Akshay offers a very structured, detailed, and personalized study plan that helped improve my fund of knowledge on a daily basis. During our one on one study sessions, he would be sure to break down complex physiological concepts and focus on subject areas that needed improvement. We would work through test taking strategies that were practical and quickly helped turn around my practice test scores. Thanks to Akshay, my Step 1 Score opened the door to a world of opportunities. To continue this pattern of success, I returned to Akshay for both Step 2 CK and CS. The results of Akshay's training were remarkable. After undergrad, I had only 2 medical school interviews, primarily because of poor test taking. By the end of medical school, I had 38 interview invitations from Internal Medicine programs throughout the country, the highest number of interview invitations for my medical school class. Fortunately, I matched into my number 1 residency program at Johns Hopkins. I would recommend Akshay to anyone looking for a tried and tested strategy for success on the USMLE. More importantly, I thank him for giving me the tools to become a better doctor.

#### With Akshay's help and support, I was able to successfully pass Step 2 CK by a good margin and ended up matching into a University residency program.

When I failed the USMLE Step 2 CK, I was concerned that I had reached my peak in knowledge retention. Leading up to the exam, I had read from multiple sources and completed over 2000 practice questions. Still, I felt unprepared to make a second attempt and was afraid I would never pass the exam. As a last effort, I decided to get a tutor.

Starting from my very first session with Akshay, I knew that he was the right tutor for me--one who would be able to guide me through what I had yet to learn. He dissected the way I had been approaching questions, refined my study schedule, and gave me tips on how to become more efficient. He taught me methods that helped drastically increase my ability to retain information. He also streamlined my studying so that I wasted less time on the unimportant things. Besides all that, Akshay was a great source of motivation and confidence.

With Akshay's help and support, I was able to successfully pass Step 2 CK by a good margin and ended up matching into a University residency program. I now apply his methods to all of my learning and never hesitate to recommend him to people I know.

#### After just a few months of online tutoring services with Akshay, I successfully passed Step 1 with significant improvement compared to my prior failed attempts.

Akshay is a very patient tutor who focuses on strengthening an individual's weaknesses to promote a successful outcome, whether their weaknesses be timing, fund of knowledge, poor sleeping habits, level of testing anxiety or a combination of the above. I personally struggled with the Step 1 Medical exam and sought out help. I was fortunate enough to work with Akshay who focused on me as a whole rather than just the fund of knowledge. After just a few months of online tutoring services with Akshay, I successfully passed Step 1 with significant improvement compared to my prior failed attempts. I was able to use the tools and skills learned during our sessions to successfully complete the remaining Medical Step exams allowing me to continue on the path of pursuing my goal of being a Pediatrician. After my success, I referred my friend to work with him and she had similar success.

#### He helped me create a schedule that was realistic for my study needs and availability.

Akshay was excellent. He was organized, flexible, and respectful of my time and money. He helped me create a schedule that was realistic for my study needs and availability. Akshay knew the material and more importantly, knew where to direct my efforts in test taking skills. I will absolutely be hiring Akshay again in the future.

#### Thanks to his guidance, my CK score was 30 points higher than my Step 1 mark! I strongly recommend Medlearnity!

I worked with my tutor for my Step 2 CK for the past 4 months. Throughout the process, he completely changed my way of approaching questions! Even though there was an adjustment period, his techniques proved to be extremely helpful and useful. He was also extremely patient and understanding throughout the entire process. His explanations of medical concepts and problems were very clear and thorough. He was also motivating with his frequent check-ins, which ensured that I gave my maximum effort on a daily basis. Thanks to his guidance, my CK score was 30 points higher than my Step 1 mark! I strongly recommend Medlearnity!

#### I cannot recommend him enough.

I worked with Akshay and would highly recommend him! He was very accommodating of my busy school schedule. He was also very organized and had so many creative ways to learn the material. He was also incredibly smart. I cannot recommend him enough.

#### I ended up passing CK with a score that I was really happy with and matched into residency.

I was having a lot of difficulties with USMLE Step 2 CK. I had reached a point where I had thought that I had peaked since my practice scores weren't improving after having already completed UWorld. Akshay helped me with my approach to the questions and taught me methods to better retain what I was learning over longer periods of time. He even helped me prioritize my learning and continued to work with me to create an adaptive study schedule that fit my lifestyle. It really improved my confidence with my knowledge which was reflected in the scores I was seeing. I ended up passing CK with a score that I was really happy with and matched into residency. I never hesitate to recommend his services to anyone I think might benefit.

#### Through his help I went from failing USMLE Step 1 to getting my number one residency in my chosen specialty.

Akshay is not only an expert in medical knowledge, but also a master educator who knows exactly how to tailor lesson plans to maximize retention, recall, and deep understanding of complex topics. Through his help I went from failing USMLE Step 1 to getting my number one residency in my chosen specialty. If I'd have found him sooner, I would have saved many hours and hundreds of dollars wasted on less worthy educational resources that I tried, including Kaplan and Doctors in Training. Now as a resident in clinical practice, the learning habits he taught me help me excel far beyond my peers. His methodology the epitome of "high-yield" learning. If you want the easiest, most efficient and most entertaining path to medical mastery, look no further!

#### I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them.

I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them. The tutoring really helped me through the daunting task of preparing for the exam, and preparing for future standardized testing as well. I was assigned a tutor for the ACM -type questions and biostats, as well as a second tutor for CCS. I also received significant, and much needed coaching from Dr. Gohel, so I actually had a team of 3 doctors helping me prep. An amazing team, sure to get even the busiest scalpel back to razor sharpness!

#### Akshay is highly knowledgeable and is very good at explaining difficult concepts with clarity and simplicity

Akshay is highly knowledgeable and is very good at explaining difficult concepts with clarity and simplicity, particularly pathophysiology which can be quite dense. He's a kind and caring teacher as well. It was a pleasure working with him!

#### I am happy to report that not only did I pass Step 1 with a much stronger score, but, even after we stopped working together, I continued to use his strategies as I prepared for subsequent tests and recently aced my specialty boards.

I initially worked with Akshay a few years ago after I had failed Step 1. We worked together via video chat which worked out great for both of our busy schedules and allowed Akshay to utilize technology to enhance my learning experience. Each session, Akshay used technology creatively to track my progress, to address my personal weaknesses and then to build skills and techniques to target my individual needs. Akshay is compassionate and patient with his students; he greatly improved my confidence as a test taker and helped me strengthen my knowledge base. I am happy to report that not only did I pass Step 1 with a much stronger score, but, even after we stopped working together, I continued to use his strategies as I prepared for subsequent tests and recently aced my specialty boards. I've worked with various tutors throughout my life and I would definitely say that Akshay stands out as unique. Akshay is clearly passionate about teaching and I would recommend him highly to anyone who is struggling or just looking to improve their score or medical knowledge.

#### I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who wants help learning invaluable skills for taking medical examinations!

I used Medlearnity over the course of six months to help prepare me for Step 1. In the past I have struggled with standardized tests and knew I would need help to achieve the competitive score I desired. Dr. Goel and Dustin were both incredible mentors and teachers! Dustin explained difficult concepts clearly and thoroughly during every session. He was always available to answer questions in-between sessions and helped me identify weaknesses in my knowledge and test-taking abilities. During my dedicated study period, Dr. Goel called me often to check on my progress, and provided me with invaluable tips and tricks to reduce my test anxiety. I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who wants help learning invaluable skills for taking medical examinations!
