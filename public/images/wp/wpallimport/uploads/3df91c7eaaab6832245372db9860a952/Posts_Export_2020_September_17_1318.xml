		<title><![CDATA[How to Study for USMLE in Quarantine: Expert Tips]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Times are challenging. The pandemic has changed a lot – how we travel, shop, and socialize. But most of all, it has taught us that doctors and healthcare professionals are fundamental to the existence of the human race. There has never been a more urgent time to study medicine.  But, the self-isolation measures we are all taking to flatten the curve may have left you wondering how to study for USMLE in quarantine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We've got you covered at Medlearnity! Here's some guidance straight from our professional tutors who have scored in the top percentiles of medical school exams (260+ on USMLE):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to Study for USMLE in COVID-19</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Create a Routine</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every night before bed, make a to-do list for the next day. When you wake up the next morning, stick to that to-do list. Don’t falter from your routine. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Set Up a Study Space</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set up a space for yourself that is designated as your “study space". You should go to that area of your home when you are ready to focus and study. Entering this space will put you in a focused mindset, and will tell your mind and body that this is where work gets done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Use Time Blocks to Break Up Your Day</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Time blocks are a great way to organize your day. You need to set distinct blocks of time for studying various topics and also for breaks. Use activities like eating and stretching/indoor exercises to break up your day – and try to find a different space for each activity. Don’t eat in the same place that you study. And similarly, don’t exercise in the same place that you study.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Limit Social Media</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scrolling through social media outlets like Facebook and Instagram are time sinks. Hours might go by before you realize that you have spent so much time doing absolutely nothing. Every day, set aside a block of time that you will dedicate to studying: say 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Also turn your phone off during this time. Stay true to not touching your phone during this time. Fight the urge – and you will see that the returns that you gain from deep focus will be enormous. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Sign Up for Professional Tutoring</h3>

Make sure you are seeking out the guidance you need – earlier is better than later. Ensure you are on the right track, and that you are effective with all the time you have at home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Video Chat With Medical School Peers, Friends, and Family</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set up a Facetime or Skype/Zoom video conference with your medical school peers every week. Use this time to catch up and ask each other questions – like a virtual study group! You can even quiz each other on questions and concepts. Plus, Zoom let's you add as many people as you'd like and you can check it out <a href="https://zoom.us/freesignup/"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">for free</span></strong></a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't forget to also set aside time to video conference with family and friends, too. You need to stay connected to your loved ones. Talking to friends and family who are not going through the medical school test-taking process is so refreshing!</p>

		<title><![CDATA[MCAT Tutoring Is Your First Step To Med School]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>MCAT Tutoring. So it’s your dream to become a doctor, huh? Well, that certainly is a very noble profession to work hard at. There are just so many things about being a medical professional that are very fulfilling. Aside from the highly alluring pay, you get to create a difference in people’s lives. You get to help them overcome whatever it is that ails them and get paid a hefty sum too. If you ask me, this right here is the textbook example of “hitting two birds with one stone.” But seriously, being able to help the community and actually making an impact in other people’s lives, no matter how small, is the best feeling in the world – ever.</p><p>This is why I can’t help but root for you as you go chasing after this dream.</p><p>However, that’s also just it. Rooting for you is all that I can do. In fact, it’s all everyone else can do for you at this point. You have to work hard from this point on by yourself; you have to keep at it by yourself. The road isn’t going to get shorter; it sure won’t get any easier either. So it really comes down to how badly you want this dream of yours to come true. Are you willing to burn sweat and shed tears just to be able to make your passion your profession? Well, if your answer is YES, then you are quite the brave heart indeed. It only goes to show how much of a great fit you are for this role. As a little good luck charm, shall I give you a couple of med school tips, future doc?</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2597" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="442" data-init-height="509" title="MCAT-Tutoring-1-1024x509" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MCAT-Tutoring-1-1024x509-1.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="442"></span><h3>The First Step Towards Becoming A Medical Professional</h3><p>Every professional starts out as a student just as every master starts out as an apprentice. You can’t become an expert at anything if you don’t take the time to learn thoroughly. Since medicine deals with real lives and real people, it’s a very strict discipline. You’ll find that this is all because of how important and dire the work involved is. When you work as an accountant and you make mistakes in your calculations, your company suffers financial losses. When you’re a doctor and you make a mistake, it’s not just money that’s lost. What may be put in peril is much more important than any paper currency – a life.</p><p>This is why the medical discipline is truly a strict one. It’s all for good reasons.</p><p>That is not to say that you have to be perfect, though. There’s a reason why doctors are said to “practice” medicine. This means that there really is no telling what can happen inside the hospital room. The most mentors can do is minimize the chances of false or wrongful diagnosis and create better prognoses. This way, more and more lives get a chance of being saved. In other words, medical standards are placed on the shoulders of any practicing professional. You can’t just do “medicine” half-heartedly; you have to invest your whole being into it. In order to do that, you have to be willing to let go of countless and countless of hours to dedicate yourself to studying. No summer breaks, no lingering relationships, and no drama. For a certain time period, you have to be prepared to let go of everything and face your studies head on.</p><p>If you’re an aspiring doctor, then I presume that you have done your initial research about medical studies already. Otherwise, I would really start to question your sincerity towards this endeavour. If I may make a wild guess, you’ve probably come across terms like MCAT, USMLE, and NBME – and I tell you that all these acronyms will matter in this journey of yours no doubt.</p><p>Before you can even become a med student, the very first exam you need to take is the MCAT or the Medical College Admissions Test. It’s a general and related sciences examination that aims to determine your learning aptitude and attitude for the sciences. After all, medicine is all about clinical science – Physics, Chemistry, and Biology are some subjects you are bound to come across with. The MCAT exam serves as the initial screening exam for people who ever wish to become doctors. So I think you might already know even without me saying this but this exam is something you shouldn’t take lightly. Remember, first impressions matter! You have to start out strong if you ever want to catch good attention in the medicine industry.</p><p>The MCAT, being an admissions test, basically decides your fate in this industry. Of course, it’s not like you can’t take it again if you fail but it’s always better to make good impressions from the very start. It’s not just to appeal to others’ opinion of you too. It’s more like you have to pass on your first try for yourself. Being able to work hard at something and actually reaping the fruits of your labor later on is the best feeling in the world. It just makes you want to try even harder. So I guess passing with flying colors in the MCAT will determine your confidence in taking up this particular field of study.</p><p>Also, the MCAT is not a pass or fail exam. I think you should know and understand this very well before you let your mind jump to conclusions. The examinees results are graded through percentiles which mean that everyone gets a score. As to whether you get a score high enough to get into your first choice medical school is a completely different story. Every school set different standards for accepting enrolees, you see. Some have very high requirements like only letting in those who’ve score in the 94<sup>th</sup> percentile or higher during the MCAT.</p><p>While I would like to say that our current education system is completely non-selective, medical schools are an exception. But their selectiveness is not out of personal bias; it is all in an effort to make sure that they get the cream of the crop. They would want to leave future generations in the hands of extremely capable people. I mean, what would happen if anyone can just become a doctor? What if we all start saying YES to people just because we see that they want something so bad? The world will be thrown into chaos, for sure. Standards are set for a reason. It just so happens that the field of medicine have much more intricate requirements than others.</p><p>I just said that some of the most prestigious schools require applicants to hit a certain percentile rank in the MCAT before they consider their applications. However, that doesn’t mean there is absolutely no hope for you. There are many recognized universities and medical schools in the entirety of the United States that allow students who did not do too well in the MCAT to still continue their studies in medicine. They just lower the percentile average for admission and allow them to study under probationary conditions. Like, if they do well in the following year, they can become full-pledged med students. After all, it’s not very accurate to judge a person’s abilities through one examination alone.</p><p>Still, if you’re aiming to enrol in one of the top tier schools of the country, then acing the MCAT is definitely something you should do. So, what is the MCAT really like?</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2086" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="442" data-init-height="509" title="MCAT-Tutoring-Classes" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MCAT-Tutoring-Classes-1024x509.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="442"></span><h3><strong>What Is The MCAT?</strong></h3><p>The MCAT or Medical College Admissions Test is the prerequisite exam every medical aspirant must take as part of their application requirements for med school. This is a preliminary test that aims to gauge the ability and knowledge of the applicant in the basic sciences. After all, medicine is all about science – particularly, life science. This is why it is necessary that someone who studies it and aims to make a living in the medical field in the future must have the right aptitude and attitude towards learning it. The MCAT makes sure that every aspirant has got what it takes to study medicine for real.</p><p>As for the technical details, this exam consists of at least 230 items that are science-related. It’s divided into 10 parts with each section having anywhere between 4 and 7 items plus 15 standalone questions in the science section and 9 passages on the CARS. Each section may have a different approach or style of questioning but all items are multiple-choice. There is no essay portion in the MCAT exam. The entirety of the test is expected to run for 6 hours and 15 minutes with a short break in-between for meals and reviewing, of course. While some people like to “wing” this exam and leaving their fates to the unknown, you might not share the same sentiment. If you want to get into a good school it is important that you score higher than average, after all. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Should You Take MCAT Tutoring Classes?</strong></h3><p>If you can handle studying alone and you’re totally comfortable with it, then you may also opt to review by yourself for the MCAT. However, there are also various institutions that provide tutoring assistance for this particular exam. This would include us, too. So if you want to check out our MCAT tutoring service as well as all our other services (including USMLE reviews and study guides), you can pay this website a visit. Tutoring will help you review not just the answers to the MCAT but actually understand the concepts behind them. A team of reputable and highly knowledgeable professionals will assist you in your studies.</p><p>If you’re thinking of getting a higher average from the get-go to create the perfect impression for your first-choice med school, then passing the MCAT with flying colors is definitely a must! It will surely add pizazz to your application.</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Improving Your USMLE Step 3 Study Schedule]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How to Create the Optimal USMLE Step 3 Study Schedule</h1>
<a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-3/">USMLE Step 3</a> is the final step in the process of being licensed to practice medicine. Once you pass this exam, you'll be eligible to able to practice medicine independently. Although there may still be specialty boards in your future, you could look at Step 3 as the culmination of your hard work to become a doctor.

By the time you get to this point, you have plenty of experience with taking standardized tests. It can even be tempting to skip the process of studying for Step 3. By the time you take this exam, you'll be in the midst of long nights of clinical practice, and you'll likely be exhausted. Studying can be a challenge. However, your Step 3 score does matter.

How should you create your USMLE Step 3 study schedule? What does your Step 3 score mean for your future in medicine? Should you even bother to worry about it? To answer these questions, it helps to begin with an overview of the whole USMLE process.

<img class="alignnone" title="study-schedule" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/study-schedule-1024x768.jpg" alt="med student taking notes" width="889" height="667" data-id="2091" data-init-width="1024" data-init-height="768" data-width="889" data-height="667" />
<h2>What you need to know about the USMLE</h2>
As you may already know, USMLE has three parts, called "steps." (Because Step 2 itself has two parts, CK and CS, one could actually consider the USMLE to be composed of four parts.)
<h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
The USMLE Step 1 is often administered after the first two years of medical school, and is a multiple-choice exam that covers the basic sciences. Many medical students consider Step 1 to be the most challenging part of the USMLE, and it requires a diligent study schedule in order to be successful. Your Step 1 <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-1-percentiles/">score</a> has a significant impact on your residency application. (If you're looking for help studying for Step 1, we offer some advice <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-study-for-usmle-step-1/">here</a>.)
<h3>Step 2 CK and CS</h3>
Step 2 consists of two separate exams, which are scheduled at different times and different testing centers. Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge) is another multiple-choice exam. Step 2 CS uses an entirely different format, with live actors playing "standardized patients." The student performs simulated patient encounters, and grading is based on the quality of the interactions with the "patient" as well the student's writeups. A numerical score is used for Step 2 CK, while Step 2 CS is pass/fail.

Generally, both parts of Step 2 are taken during the third or fourth year of medical school. In fact, many medical schools require passing Step 2 in order to graduate, and some residency programs will also require Step 2 CK scores in order to rank an applicant for the Match. This means the test must be taken by around January or early February of the fourth year of med school. (This gives time for the results to be reported, which can take 3-4 weeks.) Many people choose to take Step 2 CK by July or early August of the fourth year, so that results are available when ERAS opens for beginning residency applications in September.
<h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
The USMLE Step 3 is a very clinically-focused exam, and is usually taken during the intern year (the first year of residency, after medical school graduation). This means that much of the material will be fresh in your mind from your time on the wards; however, it also means that you'll have to study for the exam while simultaneously completing your highly demanding intern year.

Step 3 is a 2-day exam. The first day is fairly similar to Step 1 and Step 2 CK, and is a 7-hour multiple-choice exam. It consists of 232 items, divided into 6 sections with no more than 40 questions each. You get an hour to finish each block, with a 45-minute lunch break after the third block.

The second day lasts 9 hours and is broken up into two different test formats. The first part is a multiple-choice test of 180 items divided into 6 sections of 30 questions each, with 45 minutes for each section. The second part consists of case simulations (administered through a computer, not using live standardized patients as in Step 2 CS). There are 13 cases, and you get 10 to 20 minutes to answer all of the questions related to each case.

You don't have to schedule the two days of Step 3 back-to-back. However, you must take Day 1 before Day 2, and the two days cannot be more than two weeks apart from each other. It's best to schedule your exam near the end of a lighter rotation, or even a period of time off. This will give you time to prepare for the exam. If you
<h2>How much does your score on Step 3 really matter?</h2>
Honestly, the answer to this question depends on what your future in medicine looks like. If you're planning to go straight into practice after your residency ends, then it may not be particularly important how well you score on this exam – as long as you pass it, of course. If you're thinking of continuing your education after residency, such as by doing a fellowship in a subspecialty, then your particular Step 3 score may become more important, especially if you've chosen a more competitive field.

<h2>How can you prepare the right USMLE Step 3 study schedule?</h2>
By the time you get to Step 3, you're an experienced test taker. At the same time, studying for this exam is a good idea, particularly if you're at all considering applying for a fellowship or another program after residency. The material you'll encounter on the wards during your intern year will very helpful on the exam, but there's a lot of random chance in which patients you happen to encounter, so relying on your intern year itself to fully prepare you is unwise. It's best to begin studying about a month before the exam.

Because Step 3 is a clinically-focused exam, you should let this guide your studying. Focus on case studies, to prepare for the case simulations you'll encounter on Day 2. Even the multiple choice questions will often as you to apply medical concepts to clinical situations, so keep this in mind as you study. <a href="https://www.amboss.com/us">AMBOSS</a> and <a href="https://www.uworld.com/">UWorld</a> are both great resources for preparing for the exam. (It's likely that you used one or both of these as you prepared for previous USMLE steps.) Your Step 3 study schedule should include a block of focused exam prep time each day.

If you're nervous about Step 3, or have not performed as well as you would have liked on previous steps, then having a tutor to help you prepare a study schedule may be helpful. Medlearnity's highly-experienced <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">tutors</a> would be happy to help you. They're physicians themselves, so they've been through this process and are excellent at guiding others to do their best on the USMLE.

		<title><![CDATA[What You Should Know About Creating A USMLE Step 1 Study Schedule]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>USMLE Step 1 Study Schedule. It is not unusual for children to dream about becoming doctors one day. In fact, you were probably a dreamer too, once upon a time. You most likely arrived on career day wearing a lab coat and stethoscope on your neck. And of course, the look wouldn’t be complete without a humongous toy injection in one hand. Becoming a doctor is a noble profession, even as children we already know that.</p><p>However, the only thing that changes over the years is our motivations to become medical professionals. As a young kid, you were probably enthralled by the idea of helping others and saving lives. While that is still true today, you are also made aware that becoming a doctor has a lot of spectacular benefits. For one, the pay looks promising. If you do well, you also get to enjoy status and authority perks that come with your position. Not to mention, you get discounts and medical coverage from your hospital of residency. We all know how demanding medical costs can be these days, after all. Becoming a resident doctor yourself is a noble and practical profession indeed.</p><p>Not that you can easily become one as soon as you wish for it, though.</p><p>As much as it is promising, the path of a medical professional is also a thorny one. It is not for the faint of heart. We’re talking about going for long hours without proper sleep, reading dozens of reference and research books way past your bed time, dealing with work assignments, internship trainings, lectures, and many other responsibilities. The path of a medical professional is an overbearing and lonely one.&nbsp;<em>Why?&nbsp;</em>Let’s just say that for the next four or five years of your life, you can give up on having any meaningful social connections. All you’re going to do is get your nose in the books.</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2574" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="593" data-init-height="683" title="USMLE-Study-schedule-2-1024x683" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/USMLE-Study-schedule-2-1024x683-1.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="593"></span><p>But if this is really your dream, nothing I say will discourage you from going down this path. You at least need that much resolve and determination if you are ever to expect passing medical school with flying colors.</p><p>The first step to becoming a doctor is getting into medical school. For that, you need to take the MCAT or the Medical College Admission Test first and foremost. This examination is administered by the American Association of Medical Colleges or AAMC. The test focuses on Physical Sciences, Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior and is conducted over the course of 7 hours and 30 minutes. A good score to aim for in the MCAT is 509 or above (out of 528). This will put you in the upper 20% of the scale and will give you better chances of getting into medical schools. Once you have passed, you will need to prepare a letter of intent indicating your desire to take up medicine (your reasons, intentions, etc.) and your CVV to apply to your school of choice.</p><p>And yet again, getting in is just the first of your problems. The “fun” really doesn’t stop here. If anything, it just keeps getting better and better. What comes next in a 3-part testing series (four, if you count the 2-CK and 2-CS separately) that will surely measure just how qualified you are to practice medicine. We call it the USMLE.</p><h3><strong>What Is The USMLE?</strong></h3><p>The USMLE is an acronym that stands for United States Medical Licensing Examination. It is a test series that is undertaken by medical students at different intervals during their time at medical school and post-graduation. This series of tests is instated and administered in order to make sure that each and every student that gets past medical school is qualified. Medical practice, after all, is a very sensitive matter. You can’t just wing your way past it. For your sake and your future patients’ well-being, certain measures must be undertaken in order to ensure safe and professional practice.</p><p>The USMLE is basically divided into three series of tests: USMLE Step 1, 2-CK and 2-CS, and 3. These tests are given at different times during your stay in medical school up until you finish your internship training. Although we would love to talk about all of them today, I’m afraid that it will take up too much of everybody’s time. So in this article, let us first discuss the USMLE Step 1. Particularly, let’s talk about how you can prepare a good Study Schedule for it.</p><h3><strong>What Is The USMLE Step 1?</strong></h3><p>Let me just get this out there first: Step 1 is the most crucial of all the steps. It is important that you score high on this test. Step 1 is the culmination of your 2 years in medical school which means that you take it when you have just passed your second year. While most people would think that this is the easiest part, the amount of material involved for this test is vast. It’s basically a knowledge test of how much you were able to absorb in the past two years. It’s mostly about basic sciences and all the subjects you covered during your first two years in medical school.</p><p>Without doubt, the USMLE is far more intricate and explorative than the MCAT so you definitely shouldn’t take it lightly. If you’re thinking of cramming it last minute, you should trash that insane idea as well. There is no way you can pass with such a half-hearted attitude. Remember that your dream isn’t the only thing that rides on this test. It’s the safety and well-being of all the people who will get involved in your practice in the future. You should at least make the effort to get a good passing grade for them.</p><p>So, this leaves us with a very important matter at hand: How can you create a study schedule effective enough to help you learn all the things you need to in the best amount of time possible? Well, we can help you out with that.</p><h3><strong>How To Create The Most Effective USMLE Study Schedule</strong></h3><p>The first step to success is to think of yourself succeeding. You know what they say, if you want it then claim it! You have to start planning your study schedule with a positive disposition. You should know in your heart that you are going to pass. Anyway, here are some ways you can prepare for the USMLE Step 1 test effectively:</p><h3><strong>Research &amp; Decide On The Material You Want To Cover</strong></h3><p>As I previously said, the amount of material you have to cover for this first step is vast and a little overbearing. However, it’s not like you have to read every book that ever existed in the history of medicine. You can go through previous USMLE study schedules, you can review previous’ years questionnaire and find out just what subjects are given more focus on. True enough, the examination changes every year so there’s really no way of telling what will come out. However, researching and deciding on the material you want to cover will at least help you organize your study schedule better, don’t you agree? &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Start Early</strong></h3><p><em>The early bird catches the worm</em>. Or in this case, the early bird gets to avoid having to cram enormous gigabytes of data on the last minute. Starting early gives you the freedom to allot your studying time more evenly throughout the days. It also helps you reduce the chances of experiencing a “burn out” and make you detest the idea of studying altogether. Instead of cramming it all in (which is impossible by the way), taking little bits of information regularly is definitely more effective. &nbsp;</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2577" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="592" data-init-height="682" title="Start-Early-Study-1024x682" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Start-Early-Study-1024x682-1.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="592"></span><h3>Never End The Day Without Opening A Book</h3><p>It’s the little things that matter, really. You don’t need to hit the books 16 hours a day and forget that the rest of the world exists. Even a lot of work would seem minimal if you do little chunks everyday. It is only when you try to take on everything at once that it gets tiring and impossible. Never end your day without reading a page or two. Always try to learn a new concept before you fall asleep. In the end, your hard work will pay off.&nbsp;</p><h3>Make Use Of Your School’s “Free Study Periods”</h3><p>Med schools often give students free time to study any material of their choosing (or not study at all). These are what you’d call “free periods” or “study hall.” As a USMLE examinee, you can utilize this time by getting some test-related review done. It would be good to officially include these free study periods in your study schedule as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Consider Getting Extra Help With Subjects You Find The Most Difficult</h3><p>If you ever need help, never be afraid to ask for it. You will have subjects you’re good at and subjects you’re terrible at. Let’s face it; that’s just how things go. You can’t possibly ace everything on your own. If there are any subjects you find extremely difficult, then getting some extra heads to help you study wouldn’t hurt. Luckily, we offer review and tutorial services for USMLE examinees like you. Don’t hesitate to get in touch with us to see what we offer.&nbsp;</p><h3>Take Mock Tests</h3><p>Lastly, taking mock exams will help you lose some nerve before the actual test. Aside from the test items, one very formidable opponent you have to watch out for is time. You roughly have 1 minute and 30 seconds to answer each item on Step 1. If you don’t practice reading and shading beforehand, you may find yourself running short on time on the day of the actual exam. Taking mock tests will not only test your knowledge but your speed as well so make sure to include mock testing dates in your study schedule. You can invite friends and colleagues for group testing too!&nbsp;</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[USMLE Step 3 Percentiles: What You Need to Know]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How can you optimize your USMLE Step 3 percentile – and does it really matter?</h1>
Step 3 is the final step in becoming licensed to practice medicine independently in the US. It's a very clinically-focused exam, designed primarily to measure the ability to diagnose and manage patients. By the time you get to this exam, you've got plenty of testing experience, having passed three previous USMLE exams (Step 1, Step 2 CK, and Step 2 CS). You have a pretty good idea of what to expect on the exam.

It's important to remember that Step 3 tests a broad range of clinical knowledge. At the same time, many of those taking it have entered a residency in a particular specialty, and are not being exposed through their clinical experiences to the broad range of material needed to pass Step 3. This is why we recommend that you don't underestimate Step 3. You will need to consciously focus on finding and addressing your weaknesses, so that you make sure that you do as well on this exam as you'd like.

What does it take to pass Step 3? Does your score on this exam matter? Here's what you need to know about the final exam in the USMLE series.
<h2>USMLE Step 3 percentiles</h2>
Although all three steps of the USMLE use a roughly similar three-digit scoring system, the specifics of the scoring differ for each exam. <a href="https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/transcripts/USMLE_Step_Examination_Score_Interpretation_Guidelines.pdf">Data</a> from the NBME indicate that, for US medical graduates taking Step 3 for the first time, the median score is around 226. The 25th percentile is around 216, and the 75th percentile is around 236. The minimum passing score for Step 3 was raised to 198 at the beginning of 2020. (Before that, it was 196.)
<h2>Does your Step 3 score actually matter?</h2>
This is ultimately what most people are wondering as they think about USMLE Step 3 percentiles. Most students stressed a lot over Step 1, and many also put significant effort into preparing for Step 2 CK. Do you need to be as worried about Step 3?

For many students, the answer is that your Step 3 score won't make too much of a difference, as long as you pass the exam. You generally won't take Step 3 until you've been in residency for a year or so, so it won't matter for your residency applications. (Consistent with this, residency program directors <a href="https://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NRMP-2018-Program-Director-Survey-for-WWW.pdf">state</a> that Step 3 is not important in their decisions. The exception might be international medical graduates, who sometimes use Step 3 to try to stand out when applying for a US residency.) If you're planning to finish your medical education at the end of your residency, then the only important thing is to pass Step 3. This will allow you to become licensed to practice medicine independently. As long as you pass the exam, it's not likely that your specific score will have a huge impact on your ability to get a job in medicine after graduation.

However, if you're thinking of applying for a fellowship after your residency, then your Step 3 score may matter more. This is especially true if you're considering a more competitive subspecialty, such as cardiology; for these subspecialties, <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">NRMP data</a> show that the median score for applicants who successfully match is around 240, which is above the 80th percentile.

For the most part, the program directors want to see that your Step 3 score is in line with the previous steps. They definitely don't want to see a failed attempt on your record, so we would never recommend that you walk into Step 3 without preparing and hope that you'll pass. Step 3 isn't the most important aspect of your fellowship application, but it could end up being the edge that gets you into the fellowship of your choice.

<h2><img class=" wp-image-3444 aligncenter" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-300x47.png" alt="" width="211" height="33" /></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2>When do you take Step 3?</h2>
In order to offer you a slot for taking Step 3, the NBME requires two things. You must have passed all of the previous steps already, and you must have officially graduated from medical school. (Note that it takes a few weeks for your graduation paperwork to filter through; if you apply to take Step 3 too soon after your graduation, then you may not be approved.)

In general, it's recommended to take Step 3 after your PGY-1 year (your first year of residency, or intern year). However, it can be taken earlier or later than this. Many programs require that you pass Step 3 by the end of your PGY-2 year, so that you become fully licensed to practice medicine independently. Most people take it near or just after the end of their PGY-1 year. Ideally, you'll want to take the exam when you have lighter clinical responsibilities (such as during a research block).

Note that, in order to become licensed to practice medicine independently, all states <a href="https://www.fsmb.org/step-3/state-licensure/">require</a> at least one year of postgraduate medical training, and some require more. Even if you pass Step 3 early on in your PGY-1 year, you still won't be able to get your license early. Some international medical graduates might choose to take Step 3 early in order to use it on their residency applications, but
<h2>How can you prepare for Step 3?</h2>
<h3>1. Commit to a test date.</h3>
Having your test date set will get you to commit to a study timeline. This is because you know how much time you have to study for the exam, so you're able to make a <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-3-study-schedule/">study plan</a>. Setting a test date will also help you to stay efficient and focused as you study, and help to stop you from procrastinating. Also, the sooner you set your test date, the better your chances of being able to take it at the most convenient testing center, so that you don't have to travel to take the exam.

Carefully consider your schedule when you select a test date. Make sure that the date you pick is during a period when you have a lighter workload. This will give you some time to study for the exam, and the two days necessary to complete it.

Keep in mind that you can either schedule the two days of the exam consecutively, or you can space them apart from each other, as long as you finish them both within 14 days. Which option you choose depends on your personal preference, as well as on your scheduling needs. The earlier you schedule your exam, the more options you'll have, so that you can choose whatever will work best for you.
<h3>2. Use Qbanks (like UWorld) effectively.</h3>
It would be a rare medical student who makes it to Step 3 without ever having used UWorld's Qbank to prepare for a USMLE exam. We recommend that you reach for UWorld again as you prepare for Step 3. You should definitely aim to get through its Step 3 question bank at least once, and preferably twice. If you finish UWorld, then AMBOSS is the next step. Make sure you're using the Qbank efficiently; try to learn as much as you can from every question, and address any knowledge gaps or other weaknesses that you discover. Doing a lot of questions, but not really understanding why you're getting certain questions wrong, will tend to lead to a plateau.

If you're consistently scoring below 70% on UWorld blocks, then it may be time to set up a session with a tutor so that you can get personalized feedback on where you're going wrong.
<h3>3. Become familiar with computer-based case simulations (CCS).</h3>
CCS are really what differentiate Step 3 from previous USMLE steps. CCS make up about 1/3 of exam performance, so it's important to be prepared for this section. The CCS software is not particularly intuitive (for example, you must "advance time" in order to progress within the simulation), and so you should make sure that you practice with it before your exam so that you don't waste time trying to figure it out. There's some information on the <a href="https://www.usmle.org/practice-materials/index.html#tab_step3_ccs">USMLE site</a> that can help you get acquainted with the software.

UWorld offers CCS questions along with the regular Qbank (which addresses the multiple-choice questions). Try to get through all of these at least once before your exam date.
<h3>4. Remember the breadth of material</h3>
In general, you'll take Step 3 after the first year of your residency. You will have spent this year learning a lot about patient care in your specialty. However, your exposure to other specialties is very limited. Remember that Step 3 covers a wide variety of patients. For example, if you're a peds intern, you'll need to spend some time brushing up on care of adult patients.
<h2>Take Step 3 seriously</h2>
We recommend that you avoid making the mistake that we sometimes see residents making – they don't take Step 3 seriously. They assume that their clinical experience during their intern year will be enough for them to pass this exam. Unfortunately, this leads to some people failing the exam and having to retake it. This is expensive and a huge hassle, and it also can take away some options in terms of fellowships later on. Make sure that you take Step 3 seriously, and spend some time studying for it.

If you want some extra help preparing for Step 3, you may want to consider reaching out to a professional tutor with experience in helping people prepare for this exam. Here at Medlearnity, <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">our tutors</a> have all scored exceptionally well on their USMLE exams, and have experience in helping others on these tests as well. Whether you have failed Step 3 or believe you might be in danger of failing it, experience test anxiety and need help with feeling more confident, or want to get a spectacular score to look great on your fellowship application, we can help you. You can schedule a <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">free one-hour session</a> to find out what tutoring is like.]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Facts About USMLE Step 2 Percentiles]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h1>What can we learn from the data about USMLE Step 2 percentiles? And does your score even matter?</h1>
<p>Among medical professionals in training, USMLE Step 1 tends to be the most feared hurdle. It's known as a difficult exam, and your score on Step 1 can have a huge impact on your ability to match with the residency of your choice. In fact, many of the more competitive residency programs report having cutoffs for Step 1 scores, and also certain scores above which they will almost always offer an interview to an applicant. (If you're thinking about Step 1 percentiles, <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-1-percentiles/">this</a> might be of interest.)</p>
<p>Many students are less worried about Step 2 than they were about Step 1. The buzz among medical students certainly suggests worrying less about Step 2. However, keep in mind that Step 2 CK can also have an impact on your residency application. If you didn't score as well as you'd have liked on Step 1, then Step 2 CK could be your chance to redeem yourself. In addition, the announcement that Step 1 will transition to being pass/fail only in 2022 means that we can expect residency programs to become more interested in using Step 2 CK scores in their decisions. (Step 2 CS is already pass/fail.)</p>
<p>If you're approaching Step 2, you may be wondering what your score on Step 2 CK actually means. What are the Step 2 percentiles? What score should you be aiming for as you prepare for residency applications?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h2>Step 2 CK percentiles</h2>
<p>One important thing to note is that, overall, Step 2 CK scores are actually higher than for Step 1 and Step 3. This could be looked at as meaning that the exam is easier; for example, it would be easier to score 240 on Step 2 CK than to score 240 on Step 1. That's true, but it's also not quite the right way of looking at things. You could also note that a 240 on Step 1 is in the 66th percentile, while a 240 on Step 2 CK is only in the 39th percentile. In other words, you need a higher score on Step 2 in order to achieve the same percentile. Because residency programs are comparing exam scores of different applicants to each other (not just looking at the number in isolation), it's your Step 2 percentile that really matters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/transcripts/USMLE_Step_Examination_Score_Interpretation_Guidelines.pdf">Data</a> provided by the National Board of Medical Examiners, which administers the USMLE, indicate that the average score for Step 2 CK, for US medical graduates, hovers just above 240 – generally it's been 242 to 243 over the past few years. The 25th percentile is around 232, while the 75th percentile is around 256. This means that if you score at or below 232, you're in the bottom 1/4 of test takers, while if you score at or above 256, you're in the top 1/4. If you score 243, you're right in the middle of the pack.</p>

<h2>Does your USMLE Step 2 percentile actually matter?</h2>
<p>This is the huge question that many students are asking. The fact is that Step 2 CK scores do have an impact on your probability of matching to your first-choice program. Step 2 will only matter more after Step 1 transitions to a pass/fail system in 2022. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3415 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-2020-08-24-at-12.05.41-AM.png" alt="step 2 ck percentiles score" width="889" height="571" /></p>
<p>In 2020, the minimum score to pass Step 2 CK is 209. There are 370 questions on the exam, and you only need to get a little over half of them right in order to pass. Don't panic too much about this exam! Still, you're probably aiming to do more than just pass. Of course, the more competitive the residency program you'd like to match with, the higher the score you should be aiming for.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mk0nrmp3oyqui6wqfm.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Charting-Outcomes-in-the-Match-2020_MD-Senior_final.pdf">2020 report</a> by the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) showed a mean (average) Step 2 CK score of 246.9 for students who matched to their first-choice specialty. As would be expected, the median score for matched applicants varied by specialty. The most competitive specialties (such as plastic surgery and dermatology) had median scores above 250, while the least competitive (including family medicine, pathology, and psychiatry) had median scores around 230 (give or take a couple of points).</p>
<p>Some students consider putting off taking Step 2 CK until after their residency applications are complete, figuring that this means it won't matter for their application. This might work in some cases, but more competitive residency programs will actually require that you take Step 2 CK in order for them to consider ranking you for their program. They want to see that your performance on this exam matches your performance on Step 1, and is strong enough that they want you in their program. You likely won't be able to get away with putting off Step 2 in order to avoid having it matter for your residency applications.</p>
<h2>Should you prepare for Step 2 CK?</h2>
<p>Step 2 CK is fundamentally a different test than Step 1. When you're taking Step 1, you've been spending most of your time in the classroom and in the library, and Step 1 primarily tests basic science facts. When you're taking Step 2, you've been spending most (okay, basically all) of your time on the wards and in the clinic, and Step 2 primarily tests clinical knowledge and reasoning. In a way, you've been reviewing for Step 2 every time you cared for a patient as a medical student. This could be a big reason why Step 2 CK scores are higher overall; medical students are better prepared for this exam, simply because of the nature of medical school itself.</p>
<p>Many students use this as an excuse not to really bother with studying for Step 2. They figure that third year will prepare them well. This gives the motivated student a great opportunity. If you actually dedicate a significant amount of time to preparing for this exam, you'll be ahead of many of your peers. If you create a study plan and stick to it, then you have the chance to do really well on Step 2 CK. This could be the edge that gets you into the residency program of your choice.</p>
<h2>Do you have a study plan for Step 2 CK?</h2>
<p>In order to get the best score you possibly can on Step 2 CK, you need an efficient and effective study plan. Medlearnity is here to help you <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">prepare</a> for Step 2 CK and beyond. Check out our <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-score-280-on-usmle-step-2-ck/">study guide</a> for Step 2, and our review of the best <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/best-resources-for-step-2-ck-prep/">resources</a> to use as you study.</p>
<p>Personalized help from a professional tutor can also make a huge difference in your score. Our students report improvements in their USMLE scores of 20 to 50 points after receiving tutoring. Your tutor will identify your strengths and weaknesses and help you create your study plan. He or she will also walk you through the process of reasoning through questions; with a good grasp of strategy, you'll feel confident on test day and be ready to ace the exam. If you'd like to see what it would be like to work with a tutor, we invite you to <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">schedule</a> a free one-hour session.</p>
<p>A great Step 2 CK score is important, but it's just one part of your overall residency application. We can also help you with other aspects of this process, including writing your <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-write-a-great-personal-statement-for-residency/">personal statement</a> and presenting your application in the best possible way. This will help you to land a residency spot in the specialty and location of your choice.</p>
<p>We wish you a bright future in the rewarding field of medicine.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[USMLE Step 1 Percentiles: What You Need to Know]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How your USMLE Step 1 percentile could make or break your residency application</h1>
Throughout the first two years of medical school, you might find yourself thinking about <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-study-for-usmle-step-1/">USMLE Step 1</a>. Of all of the exams in med school (and there's certainly no shortage), this one tends to create the most anxiety. Step 1 is known for being a difficult exam, and the results can be hugely important to your residency applications. This is why many medical students invest a great deal of time in studying for it, hoping that a high USMLE Step 1 percentile will help them to match with the residency of their choice later on.

What do the scores on this test actually mean? What would be a passing score, a decent score, a great score? Most importantly, what can you do to improve your performance on this crucial exam?

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-3380 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resize-1598044929139576448shutterstock104439494-scaled.jpg" alt="Usmle step 1 percentiles" width="2560" height="1707" />
<h2>MCAT versus USMLE</h2>
It's no surprise to anyone that medical students are excellent test takers. Keep in mind that everyone taking the USMLE also took the MCAT – and they did well enough to get into medical school. That was after they'd likely also performed well on previous standardized tests (such as the SAT). When you take USMLE Step 1, you're competing against a group of people who may very well be the best test takers in the nation.

This is why percentiles are so important. When a residency program is considering applicants, they won't just be looking at your score in isolation; they'll be looking at it relative to the scores of other applicants. If you want your Step 1 score to help you stand out from the crowd, then you'll want to score in as high a percentile as possible.
<h2>USMLE Step 1 percentiles</h2>
The exam itself has 280 questions (7 blocks of 40 questions each). The top score is theoretically 300, although nearly all scores are in the range of 140 to 260. (The exact formula for calculating the score is a bit of a mystery, although we do know that it takes into account the calculated difficulty of your version of the test, since each person who takes the exam sees a slightly different version of it.)

<a href="https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/transcripts/USMLE_Step_Examination_Score_Interpretation_Guidelines.pdf">Data</a> provided by the National Board of Medical Examiners, which administers the USMLE, indicate that the median score (the 50th percentile) for Step 1, for US medical graduates who are taking the test for the first time, is about 232. The 25th percentile is around 217, while the 75th percentile is around 244. This means that if you score at or below 217, you’re in the bottom 1/4 of test takers, while if you score at or above 244, you’re in the top 1/4. If you score 232, you’re right in the middle of the pack.
<h2>Do USMLE Step 1 percentiles actually matter?</h2>
Ultimately, the pressing question on every medical student's mind is whether their score on Step 1 will matter for their residency application. The answer is a resounding yes. In fact, your score on Step 1 is one of the primary factors that goes into deciding whether a residency program will even offer you an interview, and also on how highly they will rank you in the Match.

The minimum <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/i-failed-usmle-step-1/">passing</a> score for Step 1 is 194. You'll need at least this score in order to eventually become licensed to practice medicine independently. However, it's likely that you want to do more than just pass. The more competitive the specialty that you'd like to enter, the higher the score that you should be aiming for.

According to 2020 <a href="https://mk0nrmp3oyqui6wqfm.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Charting-Outcomes-in-the-Match-2020_MD-Senior_final.pdf">data</a> provided by the National Residency Match Program (NRMP), which administers the Match, the mean (average) score for US medical graduates who matched to their top specialty choice was 234. The median score varied a lot between specialties, with the median Step 1 score for those who matched to a competitive specialty (like dermatology or plastic surgery) being around 250, while the median for those in the least competitive specialty (family medicine) was around 220. When you take Step 1, you won't have spent time in your clinical rotations yet, and so you might not be certain which specialty you'd prefer to match in. In order to keep your options open, the best plan is to score as highly as possible on Step 1.

<h2>Do you have a study plan for USMLE Step 1?</h2>
If you'd like to score in the higher range of USMLE Step 1 percentiles, then you'll need a good study plan. Remember that you're competing against the best test takers in the nation; if you want to stand out, then you'll need to be diligent about preparing for the exam. Creating a <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-1-study-schedule/">schedule</a> is essential to keep you on track and ensure that you're meeting your study goals.

Individual help in creating your study plan for Step 1 could make a huge difference in your score. Our professional <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">tutors</a> will help assess your strengths and weaknesses, and create a personalized plan that helps you to improve your performance on the exam. All of our Medlearnity tutors have scored 250+ on their USMLE exams, so they know what it takes to succeed. (What does it take to score 250+? <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-study-for-usmle-step-1/">Here</a> are some of our tips!) They can walk you through the process of thinking through an exam question, and help you identify your weak areas so that you can target your studying effectively. Our students report improvements of 20 to 50 points on their USMLE scores after receiving tutoring.

Some students choose tutoring because they're concerned about failing the exam, or perhaps they have failed in the past. Others choose it because they're already doing fine, but they want to achieve a great score so that they can set themselves apart on their residency applications. Still others have test anxiety, and want the guidance of a professional so that they can feel more confident and perform at their best. For all of these students, having someone in their corner who's been through this process and who's invested in their success can be extremely valuable.

You can try out a free one-hour session to get an idea of what it would be like to have professional guidance as you go through this demanding process. Learn more or book your session <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">here</a>.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Medlearnity’s team will help you craft a compelling personal statement, secondary applications, shine on your interviews, and much more! Here is how we break down our work:&nbsp;</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2563" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="592" data-init-height="682" title="Medical-Advicing-Services-1-1024x682" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Medical-Advicing-Services-1-1024x682-1.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="592"></span><p><strong>Brainstorming (i.e., for personal statements and secondary applications), Mock Interviews and Application Strategy:</strong> This time is one-to-one meeting time on Zoom. Getting feedback to help brainstorm before writing can often help you form a more persuasive statement earlier and save you frustration down the road. Furthermore, like anything competitive, having an organized approach and strategy can make a significant impact! I can’t tell you how many times a well-placed email to admissions has opened significant doors and opportunities.&nbsp;</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2564" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="442" data-init-height="509" title="Discussion-about-Medical-Advicing-Services-1024x509" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Discussion-about-Medical-Advicing-Services-1024x509-1.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="442"></span><p><strong>Document editing and feedback:</strong> We schedule half of our meeting time towards editing documents on a shared Google document and the other portion towards meeting you on Zoom to discuss the feedback. I know a lot of companies are email-based, but this works much better in my experience. For example, if you were working on a personal statement and completed your first draft, we would schedule 30 minutes to edit the document and then 30 minutes to meet with you to discuss the feedback. (Note that brainstorming before writing would fall into the category above). This 50/50 ratio works very well in my experience and allows us to stay flexible with your needs. Writing something powerful is a continuous process, and it’s hard to always fit into a timeline. You can also use this service to get help crafting persuasive emails, thank you letters, or anything similar. With secondary applications, there is a decent amount of writing involved.&nbsp;</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Introducing The World Of Internal Medicine - & How You Can Be Part of It]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Internal Medicine Board Exam. You might come across this term all the time in medical school. You probably hear people talk about it; see name plates with the title “Doctor of Internal Medicine” right under an MDs name. You see it all the time but do you actually understand what it means? For all you know, you’ve been using this term wrong after all this time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The common
understanding is that internal medicine strictly has to do with dealing about
diseases, medical conditions, and problems that afflict internal organ systems.
While that is true to some point, it’s really not why this term has been
created. If you go solely by this definition, you can raise a couple of curious
questions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>If there is internal medicine, then is there external
medicine?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>If internal medicine covers diseases and medical
conditions that manifests “internally,” then is it safe to assume that it can
cater to any part of the world’s demographic, adults and children included, as
long as the symptoms manifest in the inside of the body?&nbsp; </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1576,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Internal-Medicine-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1576"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking at it
from this point of reason, it would be inadequate to define internal medicine
as simply the branch of medical science that deals with conditions which
manifest internally. Surely, there is more to it than that. And today, we’re
going to help you get to the bottom of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is internal
medicine exactly and how do you become an MD who practices it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Internal Medicine – Explained</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is probably
news to you but the most notable factor in IM is that the demographic it caters
to are adults.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, you got
that right. It’s not just because it deals with internal organ systems and the
conditions that afflict them but because they deal with the adult population in
general. This also means that an IM is not an authority when it comes to
handling cases involving children. That is already a paediatrician’s area of
expertise. If you want to cover a much broader spectrum in your medical
studies, become a “general” doctor as some would say, the best option is to
become a family physician that will allow you to cater to young and adult patients
to some extent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Internal
Medicine or IM doctors are called “Internists” just as a pediatric doctor is
called a “Pediatrician.” Internists deals with the prevention, diagnosis, as
well as implementing treatment plans and strategies for adult diseases like
Hypertension, Diabetes, and Arthritis. Adult diseases generally cover
adolescent and post adolescent medical concerns and conditions. It also deals
with more diseases that may be acquired as an adult like Sexually Transmitted
Diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, there are
a lot of medical professionals that study to become internists. There are those
who further narrow their field of focus and choose a specific organ system to
specialize in like Cardiology, Endocrinology, Gynecology, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are more
interested in treating adult patients but don’t specifically want to narrow
down your practice, then becoming an internist is a possible choice for you as
well. But you don’t “just become” an internist. Of course, there are certain
conditions that must be met.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First and foremost,
you have to get certified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How Does One Become An Internist?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So this is
probably the next question that pops into your head: How do you become a Doctor
of Internal Medicine anyway?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, like all
specialized fields of practice, you have to get yourself certified by taking
the Internal Medicine Board Exam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The
certification examination is administered by the ABIM or American Board of
Internal Medicine in the US. In order to even step foot in the examination room
and be allowed to try for the examinations, you have to meet certain
eligibility requirements. Here they are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First up is
residency. You have to work up your eligibility status by practicing your
chosen field of medical practice as an intern. You can’t just jump right into
treating patients by yourself as soon as you graduate from the medical program.
After all, you should know by now that this profession requires you to deal
with sensitive and overly important matters (you are literally dealing with
life and death) which is why it is necessary for you to have the most extensive
training possible. The residency training usually lasts up to 36 months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While you are
serving your residency period, you will be observed and evaluated for the 6
core competencies defined by the ABIM for all practicing physicians. These 6
include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Patient
care and procedural skills</li><li>Medical
knowledge</li><li>Practice-based
learning and improvement</li><li>Interpersonal
and communication skills</li><li>Professionalism
</li><li>Systems-based
practice</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is only when
you have satisfactorily met these 6 core competencies and recognized for it
that you can proceed with the board examinations. These core competencies are
important as they are the traits and values much needed in the independent
practice of Internal Medicine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, you will
need a valid medical license issued by the governing authorities of either USA
or Canada in order to be eligible for the exam. This means that you have
already accomplished pre and post medical studies requirements. There are also
procedural requirements such as the demonstration of certain medical
procedures. You must be able to perform these procedures safely and competently
in order for the ABIM to grant you eligibility status.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you’re done
with all of these pre-examination requirements and you’ve satisfactorily met
everything that the ABIM is asking for, especially where competencies are
concerned. The only thing left to do is to schedule and take the Board
Examination which is a 10-hour exam of 240 questions. These questions are
divided into 60 items per session and are given in a multiple-choice format.
There is a single-best answer for each question so that’s basically the biggest
challenge in taking this exam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not like
you can’t prepare for it though. With the right pre-examination prepping, you
can pass this the Internal Medicine Board Examination with flying colors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Preparing for the Internal Medicine Board Examination</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are
basically two ways you can approach this: Self-study or review with the right
learning center. Having to deal with the pre-examination requirements is tough
enough as it is, you at least owe it to yourself to ask for a little help.
Fortunately, Medlearnity has got everything you need to prep for the exam – and
you don’t even have to leave the comforts of your own home doing so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The key to
passing this exam is to increase the efficiency of your review. This doesn’t
necessarily mean reading tons and tons of pages you know you can never digest
all at once. It’s about taking out the most important tidbits of information
and learning how to apply them in real-world situations.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medlearnity can
also help you digest the content of practice and mock exams as well as help you
improve your study schedule for the Board Examinations. You can read more about
their services here.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

		<title><![CDATA[Are You Taking The Family Medicine Board Exams? Read This]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Family Medicine Board Exams. If it has always been your dream to become a doctor, probably even way back when you were in kindergarten, you’re likely shocked about the intricacies of the medical field by the time you got there. For Career Day, wasn’t wearing an oversized lab coat and plastic stethoscope enough to earn you praise from your teachers and peers? Weren’t you a highly revered medical expert just because you’ve got glasses on and maybe a humongous toy injection in one hand? Little did you know that the real road to achieving this pipe dream is a crazy one. And half of the time, you’re not even sure if you’re going in the right direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckily, there
are websites like ours that genuinely want to help you out when the going gets
tough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, we are
going to walk you through the Family Medicine Board Exams – what it is, why you
need to take it (or should you even take it?), and how you can be qualified for
it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1581,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Health-Professional-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1581"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Determining Your Specialization</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe that
more than the challenges you have to overcome in order to achieve that MD
status, deciding on what facet of medicine you’re going to focus on is much
more confusing. You would think that getting that degree and passing the USMLE
are all the things you need to do to finally have your future path dawn on you
but you’re quite mistaken. Like how the twigs diverge from a branch of a tree
to how branches swerve from the trunk, multitudes of possibilities lie ahead of
you in the medical industry. And as much as you would want to explore each and
every one, you’ll need all the time in the world to do it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So YES, you have
to make that big decision: What are you going to specialize on?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Staying a
general practitioner is an option but it is not advised. After all, it is hard
to gain the trust of the masses if you are not a subject-expert about anything.
Still, the desire to help all kinds of people from all walks of life regardless
of sex, age, ethnicity, and status in life is an understandable desire in many
health professionals. This is why instead of becoming a general practitioner, why
not become something better? Here we introduce Family Medicine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What Is Family Medicine?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you may
already know, there are many paths a doctor can take. He or she can choose a
specialization based on demographic, organ systems, or type of procedure. For
example, you may choose to specialize in medical diagnoses and treatments of
adult patients. That would make you an internist. If you choose a
specialization based on organ systems, a good example is gynecology – a
specialization that centers on the reproductive system of males and females.
Lastly, you can decide your specialization through function. Will you become an
OPD or Surgical Doctor? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These paths
diverge in the world of medicine and choosing just one is more challenging than
it seems. It’s not like you can try to take on everything either. If you want a
more generalized approach to medicine that will allow you to help as many
people as possible, regardless of the area of concern, becoming a family doctor
is the most plausible option for you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Family medicine
is exactly as it sounds. It’s a branch of medicine that’s broad enough to help
you cater to a family’s concerns as a whole. It involves learning masterful
medical techniques that will allow you to provide expert help for an entire
household where acute and chronic medical conditions are concerned. This means
that family medicine is basically a type of practice that’s holistic in
approach. It allows you to handle children and adults alike and foster better
doctor-patient relationships with them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After all,
Family Medicine is founded for this very purpose. Specialized practice
generally negates the idea of fostering long-term relationships with clients.
If every doctor specializes on one thing, it would be hard for patients to
establish a solid relationship with any of them. They will be clinic-hopping
for every concern they have. Family doctors bridge this gap. They are able to
maintain long-term relationships with patients because they are able to cover a
wider range of medical problems that are common to children and adults alike. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your idea of
medicine is being of service to anyone who needs help, then this is the best
medical track for you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How To Apply For The Family Medicine Board Exams?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before you
even get ahead of yourself, first things first: You need to take the Family
Medicine Board Exams or FMBE. This is the only way you can be legally certified
to practice this field of medicine.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before anything
else, you would need to complete a residency training in order to be eligible
to take the FMBE. On average, you will need to complete a total of 3 years
residency, 4 or 5 in some other countries like Canada. Once you complete this
residency period, you are given another 3 years to pass the actual exam. But
not without having to complete the CEP or Certification Entry Process, though.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CEP is a
5-step process that you must follow in order to advance to the examination day.
We decided to digest all 5 steps below:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Self-assessment
– You need a total of 50 points for this one. You will need to take at least
one KSA (Knowledge Self-Assessment), one PI or Performance Improvement test and
other activities such as additional KSAs and CKSAs. Practically speaking, you
just need to take enough tests to earn you 50 points.</li><li>150 CME
Credits – That’s right. Within the allotted three-year time period, you must be
able to achieve 150 Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits. </li><li>Compliance
to the American Board of Family Medicine Guidelines</li><li>Payment
and Submission of Processing Fee</li><li>Submission
of application as well as the actual exam fee</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure that
your application to take the exam is approved (you can check this online).&nbsp; Once everything is in place, the only thing
left to do is to pick a testing center that’s convenient for you and to brave
through the FMBE. Of course, your victory is not merely attributed to just
luck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many
measures you can take in order to ensure the success of your test results. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1585,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Family-Medicine-1024x509.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1585"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What To Expect In The FMBE?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I know a lot of
people who fail to pass their board or licensure examinations just because they
weren’t able to maintain their cool during the test. This is why I advise you
to try to calm yourself before you start answering on the day of the exam.
Don’t try to look at the paper as a whole and instead, just answer one item at
a time. If all you think about is how hard the questions are or how much you
don’t know about them, you’ll just end up feeling overwhelmed. It will make you
lose your better judgement so you end up choosing answers you feel pressured to
choose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The exam
duration is roughly 6 hours in total. It’s a one-day examination with a
100-minute break in-betweens. There are a total of 300 questions divided into 4
different sections. You get to have 95 minutes to complete each set of 75
questions (which is a fourth of 300). If you really think about it, that gives
you a little over a minute to answer – which I think is reasonable time for
state exams. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since it’s in
multiple-choice format, the best approach would always be to “comprehend” what
you are learning. Question masters can do all sorts twists to make your life
more difficult so it’s important not just to memorize concepts but also learn
them by heart. That way, you won’t find it difficult to decipher the right
answer even if the question has been flipped over several times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How To Prepare for The FMBE?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The FMBE is
taken every 10 years. That’s right; your license to practice becomes outdated
after a certain amount of time passes. After all, there’s so much medicine can
achieve in just 10 years. You have to consistently and constantly prove that
you are on top of your game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To best prepare
for the exam, maintaining a good and healthy study schedule as well as
acquiring source materials that are likely to be used for the examination are
great options to consider. You can also refer to one-on-one tutoring if you
want a review experience that is more suitable for you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckily,
Medlearnity has just the thing for it. We can help you successfully review exam
materials that are fundamental to the upcoming FMBE. We can help you digest
mock test results as well as explain concepts that are still rather confusing
to you.</p>

professionals should also help fellow medical professionals. With Medlearnity,
you are in good hands! </p>

		<title><![CDATA[The Right Approach To The COMLEX-USA Exam – Tips &#038; Tricks]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>COMLEX-USA Exam. The road to becoming a medical professional is a long and tricky one; it’s also pretty full of surprises so at best, all you can do is hang on tight. Just when you think you’re about to cross that elusive finish line, it slips from your grasps yet again. I know; it can be tiring and frustrating but it’s all going to be worth it in the end. The prestige, financial gains, and fulfilling experiences of a medical professional are far too precious to ignore. Your hard work will pay off soon – believe it.</p><p>One thing that is practically inseparable from the pursuit of a career in medicine is: EXAMS.</p><p>That’s right horrific, stressful, and nerve-wracking exams. From the start of your career up to climbing up the ranks, these exams will always come knocking down your door. They’re taunting and often demanding so I can understand why you dread them so much. However, by now, you should know that with sufficient preparation, there’s really nothing to be afraid of – even if what you’re about to take next is the&nbsp;<strong>COMLEX</strong>.</p><p>But before that, let’s do a quick run down memory lane:</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2601" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="593" data-init-height="683" title="Exams-Medical-Aspirants-1024x683" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Exams-Medical-Aspirants-1024x683-2.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="593"></span><h3><strong>Exams Medical Aspirants Need To Take</strong></h3><p>The day you decided to take up medicine was the day you were made aware that you had to take the MCAT or the Medical Colleges Admissions test which is a prerequisite to your enrolment to med school. That was probably the first of the many encounters you had with national, standardized medical exams and also probably the one you dreaded the most. After all, it was a deciding moment for your medical career.</p><p>Administered by the AAMC or the Association of American Medical Colleges, it’s a 7 and a half hour exam consisting of 230 multiple choice items that covers basic knowledge of sciences and passage-based questions meant to deliberate your aptitude for medical courses. The score you get from the MCAT literally decides where your medical career will take you. Most schools have cut-off scores, after all. If you’ve got a target institution in mind, it’s crucial that you pass their standards. Luckily, we have MCAT tutoring to help our newcomers achieve better ranks these days.</p><p>Just when you’ve managed to climb that steep hill, a valley, cliff, and mountain happens to block your way again – maybe visualize it with blizzards and hail for a little razzle-dazzle. After two years of medical school (which are also ridden by qualifying exams, by the way), you come face to face with the USMLE – an even bigger headache that you have to brave through. The USMLE or the United States Medical Licensing Examination is a three-part test series consisting of three “Steps.” Well, four if we’re going to be strict about it. We have Step 1, 2-CK (for Clinical Knowledge) and 2-CS (for Clinical Skills), and finally, Step 3 which is a 2-day examination.</p><p>Step 1 is taken after the first two years of med school and basically covers all the subjects you’ve covered at that time plus the integration of other branches of basic science. If you’re a little behind subjects, then you may really want to pick up the pace, maybe go for USMLE tutoring. Step 1 is, after all, the most important of the exams as it will heavily affect your application for residency. If a satisfactory score is met, previous takers often advise students to apply for residency before they take Step 2 as the outcome of which may affect the overall result of Step 1. Step 2-CK and CS is taken in the third or fourth year and can be taken together or with an interval in-between.</p><p>Lastly, Step 3 is a pass or fail exam. You basically just have to pass here; your marks won’t affect your residency at this point because (1) you probably got in already and (2) most medical establishments don’t care as much for Step 3 as they do for the other two tests. Still, Step 3 is incredibly long and arduous, even taking 2 whole days to complete. If you want to keep your record clean and consistent, improving your study schedule as well as getting tutoring for Step 3 is also advised. After all, you can never prepare too much for a USMLE exam, only too little.</p><p>There is a way for you to evade the USMLE and still become a medical practitioner, though. But I wouldn’t jump up and down upon hearing this if I were you. There’s a catch, you see. To avoid taking the USMLE test series, you have to take the COMLEX – which is, by the way, pretty much the same with the USMLE in terms of length and difficulty.</p><h3><strong>Getting To Know COMLEX-USA</strong></h3><p>COMLEX-USA or the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination of the United States is a three-part exam series taken by those who wish to become a licensed osteopath. These are national, standardized exams administered by the NBOME or National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (for the USMLE, the NBME is the one to administrate the exams).&nbsp;</p><p>As you may already know, Osteopathy is a branch of alternative medicine that makes use of the manipulation of joints, muscles, and bones physically to treat many known, medical disorders. The person who practices Osteopathy is referred to as an osteopath or DO (Doctor of Osteopathy). As you may see, it’s a very specific career track in medicine; it’s a specialized branch. In fact, we have osteopathic medical schools specifically for people who want to pursue a career in this medical track.</p><p>So if you are trying to become a DO, then you have the option to not take the USMLE and take the COMLEX instead. You can take both exams to improve your application for residency but if you do, you have to make sure that your results in USMLE are highly satisfactory. If you think you might blow it on Step 1, then it’s best to focus all your efforts on the COMLEX exam. After all, you cannot “NOT” take the COMLEX; it’s a requirement to become a DO.</p><p>Anyway, here’s a brief run-down of what to expect in the COMLEX-USA licensure examinations:</p><p>If the USMLE has “Steps,” the COMLEX has “Levels.” Specifically, it has Level 1, Level 2-CE and Level 2-PE, and Level 3 – like I said, they’re way too similar right? Aside from 2-PE which is a patient-based evaluation of the test taker’s osteopathic patient care skills, all other levels are computer-based, standardized exams that mostly cover osteopathic knowledge.</p><span><img alt="" data-id="1250" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="593" data-init-height="683" title="Medical-Career" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Medical-Career-1-1024x683.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="593"></span><p>But compared to the USMLE, the length of the COMLEX is pretty overbearing. They’re twice the number of items found in each step of the USMLE with COMLEX Level 1 and 2-CE having 400 questions each and Level 3 having 420 questions in total. With almost twice the number of questions, the length of time you have to take the COMLEX-USA is basically synonymous to the USMLE (around 7.5 hours excluding breaks) which means that you have to answer each question for half the time allotted or just around 45 seconds each. Now you need extremely fast reading and answering skills for that.</p><p>But you know what they say:&nbsp;<em>Practice makes perfect.&nbsp;</em>Or at least, in this case, practice makes you score high. And that is just what you need to ultimately fulfill your career goals. There are practice tests released by the NBOME that can help you chisel your knowledge and exam skills; they can help you practice answering questions within the time allotted as well. However, these practice tests would only come with plain answers – no guide or explanations. It’s up to you to figure out why the answers are what they are; it’s up to you to improve your knowledge fluency. This is why we offer to help.</p><p>In order to help you understand subject matters holistically, Medlearnity is offering a tutoring program for COMLEX-USA takers. While self-study is strongly advised, having experienced and knowledgeable mentors guide you through the process of learning individual subjects will help improve your overall understanding of osteopathic concepts that will, in turn, allow you to comprehend exam questions better. Licensure examinations will have many situational questions, after all. This is why you need not only learn the concepts; you have to know how to apply them in practical situations as well.

		<title><![CDATA[Getting To Know The NBME Step 1 Practice Exams]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>NBME Step 1 Practice Exams. Like it or not, medicine is always going to be a battle of knowledge – both textbook and practical knowledge. After all, as someone who’s aspiring to become a future doctor, the only way your mentors can prepare you is through letting you absorb as much knowledge as you possibly can. This way, when the time comes for you to make a crucial call, you’ll be doing it after much preparation. This is regardless of the results of your decision too. Whether you make a good or bad call, the most important thing is that you made that decision with as much consideration in mind. There’s a reason why it is called the “practice of medicine.” It’s because from the start till the end of your professional career, you won’t know for sure if you’re doing the right thing. The only thing you can do is learn so much that you, yourself, have faith in your own judgement.</p><p>In line with the mission of producing highly capable and experienced individuals in the field of medicine, certain measures of quality must be put in place. If you have a friend or a family member who’s been through the painstaking process of getting a medical degree, then you probably have an idea (more or less) about what it’s like to be a med student. You’ve probably witnessed relationships fail and mental breakdowns before your very eyes too. Well, such is the melancholy of an aspiring doctor. You have to let go of a lot of things in order to chase after one grand dream. Don’t worry, though. Such valiant and loyal efforts are rewarded plenty in the end – assuming you make it through in one piece!</p><p>Now, that little pep talk didn’t come out the way I want it too but honesty is something that’s extremely valued in these parts of town so I guess I did you a favour by being brutally honest. If that gave you a scare but still refuse to give up on this dream of yours anyway, congratulations. You are emotionally ready to take on this conquest.</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2592" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="592" data-init-height="682" title="Practice-Exam-1024x682" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Practice-Exam-1024x682-1.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="592"></span><h3><strong>Starting Your Career In The Medical Field</strong></h3><p>But how do you become a doctor exactly? I’m pretty sure you’re wondering about this too. Well, obviously, you have got to get a medical degree and you can only do so after you get accepted in a med college or university. Of course, this part is far from a breeze but I bet you already know that too. So you start by taking the MCAT or Medical College Admissions Test. This is a prerequisite exam for all med school applicants. It’s something that you need to take if you ever want to get into any university.</p><p>I don’t think I need to mention it but you need to get a satisfactory score on this 6.5-hour exam. It consists of at least 230 total questions and is divided into 10 parts, each having 4 to 7 items about a particular field of science. There are also 15 stand-alone questions in the science section plus 9 passages on the CARS. It’s basically a test that determines the extent of your knowledge of the medical sciences as well as measures your aptitude for learning them. I guess it would be safe to say that this exam determines your future in med school. If you end up not passing with flying colors but still want to continue on this track, there’s nothing to stop you from taking it again though.</p><p>If you want to get into a good university, acing this exam should be a natural priority of yours. This exam will strongly affect your application for medical studies, after all. It’s best to start eyeing universities from the get-go and checkout their averages for admission. This will help you establish a benchmark for yourself. The finest institutions will, without doubt, require a higher test score on the MCAT because of two reasons: (1) They want to train the best of the best and (2) they may have many applicants so a higher average would help them filter applicants faster.</p><p>If you’re worried about taking the MCAT, you can always sign up for tutoring classes. MCAT Tutoring is a cram-school course that can help you get a better feel of the exam. They can help you prep for the questions and exam requirements. After all, it feels much better to be with fellow aspirants before taking the nerve-wracking exams. It will certainly help you ease your nerves as well as seek help from peers.</p><p>But you should know that the journey doesn’t stop with the entrance examinations. In fact, if you’re aiming to become a medical professional, you should brace yourself for so much more. Say, the USMLE test series.</p><h3>What Is The USMLE?</h3><p>The USMLE or United States Medical Licensing Examination is a three-part test series that is given in intervals during the course of your stay in med school. These “parts” are namely USMLE Step 1, 2, and 3 (I know; it’s not very creative but simplicity is always good). Actually, there are four parts if you count Step 2-CK (Clinical Knowledge and 2-CS (Clinical Skills) separately since you do have the option to take them at separate schedules. If you want to know more about the USMLE, you can check out the guides we have on-site that specifically explores the topic. Today, we have a slightly different agenda although it is still somewhat involved with the USMLE test series.</p><p>The only thing you need to know right now is that out of the three exams, Step 1 is the most crucial. This test is often administered after the first two years of med school. And appropriately enough, it’s a knowledge test about the basic sciences as well as all the subjects you covered in the first two years of your schooling. Naturally, it’s going to be a pretty long exam consisting of 280 questions divided into 7 sections of 40 items each. It may just be 280 multiple-choice items but that’s also 280 items that you don’t know where or when you’ve read about. In fact, it’s not even sure if you’ve come across the answers to those questions yet. You can’t possibly memorize everything that you’ve learnt over the past two years and this is why a thorough review is necessary.</p><p>With your schedule as hectic as it is even without the exams, it’s hard to find time – let alone discipline yourself – to study for Step 1. So, this is where we “step” in. We offer tutoring and review classes specifically catered to USMLE Step 1 takers. Aside from review classes, you should also take the time to do the NBME Step 1 Practice Exams. I’ll expound more on what these are below.</p><h3><strong>What Are NBME Step 1 Practice Exams?</strong></h3><p>As you may already know, the NBME or National Board of Medical Examiners is the governing body that administers the USMLE exams. Although they are behind the notorious test series that is feared by many examinees, they are not all that heartless. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have made the CBSSAs or Comprehensive Basic Science Self Assessments which are 200-item practice tests that is meant to help students prepare for the USMLE exams better.</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2595" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="593" data-init-height="683" title="Practice-Exams-in-medical-1-1024x683" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Practice-Exams-in-medical-1-1024x683-1.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="593"></span><p>Needless to say, these practice exams would not be the same as the USMLE but it does help you prepare yourself mentally for the exams. It will cover similar topics and concepts to help you get a feel of what the real thing would look like. But keep note: While the USMLE Step 1 consists of 280 items, the CBSSA forms are far more plenty than that. So it’s not like the jurors are spoon-feeding you the answers to the Step 1 exam. One CBSSA form will have 200 questions. And guess what? You can take as many as 11 (or maybe even more if you back track other forms that have been retired already) forms before your actual exams. If each 200-item questionnaire takes up 5 hours of your time, imagine how long it would take you to finish 2200 questions. And you don’t even know which ones are going to be included in the actual exam! It will surely take a lot of brain and willpower but hey, it also means a golden opportunity to actually ace your exams.</p><p>Recently, there have been changes in the CBSSA forms released by the NBME. For one, forms 3, 15, 16, 17, and 19 that have been used up until last year have been put to retirement already (18 is still available) and have been replaced with 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24. This means that there are five sets of new questions and since the CBSSA answer guides only&nbsp;<em>highlight</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>not explain</em> the answers, you probably won’t get anywhere trying to search for answer explanations online at this time. At the very least, it would take months or even years before someone somewhere gives rough explanations about the answers – not that you should trust them because they’re totally unverified so you may be lead to misconstrue and misunderstand some things.</p><p>The best way to face NBME Step 1 Practice Exams is to have real, dedicated and knowledgeable mentors assist you every step of the way.</p><p></p><p>NBME Step 1 Practice Exams.

		<title><![CDATA[Should You Be Concerned With The USMLE Step 2 Study Schedule?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>USMLE Step 2 Study Schedule. If you’re here then that must only mean one thing. You’ve managed to survive Step 1. Hopefully, it was because our Step 1 Study Schedule Guide helped you out. For first timers, you can check that one out first before reading this.</p><p>Anyway, we all understand how stressful and demanding the life of a med student is. It’s really no small thing having to spend long hours studying while working on your internship too. But I guess at the end of the day, you are doing it for a noble dream and I think that’s really admirable.</p><p>Before we move on to discussing USMLE Step 2 Study Scheduling Techniques, first I want to congratulate you for getting this far. The USMLE or United States Medical Licensing Examination test series is not something you can just breeze through, after all. This 3-part testing series was made to be challenging so that the AAMC can really funnel out the cream of the crop. Going into medical practice means that you get to be responsible of people’s lives and well-being in the future. This is why the level of difficulty of the screening tests are quite reasonable.</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2093" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="592" data-init-height="682" title="USMLE-Study-Schedule-1" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/USMLE-Study-Schedule-1-1024x682.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="592"></span><p>As a review, and for those who have absolutely no idea about what the USMLE is, let me do a brief explanation.</p><h3>What Is The USMLE?</h3><p>The United States Medical Licensing Examination is a three-part testing series administered at different times throughout your stay in medical school and even after you accomplish your internship training. It has three parts (four if we are to count the sub-steps in Step 2 separately): USMLE Step 1, 2-CK and 2-CS, and 3. These tests tap into different areas of medical knowledge, skills, and attributes that are all crucial for a medical professional to have. I guess one can say that it’s an evaluative procedure conducted to make sure that the new generation of doctors released into the world are all outstanding and capable of saving lives.</p><p>For Step 1, the test is comprised of 280multiple choice items divided into 7 sections. This means that each section would hold 40 questions. The examinee must accomplish all these questions in one hour or less; this gives them roughly 1 minute and 30 seconds to answer each item on the questionnaire. The entire test takes up a total of 7 hours with a 45-minute lunch break and 15-minute review time allowed. It’s a fairly long and strenuous exam so you could see why a lot of students worry a lot about taking it. Step 1 covers the basic sciences and subjects students take up in the first two years of medical school which is why it is administered after the second year. It also has the most weight in the entire testing series so examinees are expected to do really well in Step 1 if they don’t want to get entangled with trouble later on.</p><p>Again, if you have successfully passed Step 1 with flying colors, you have my congratulations. If you’re still just about to take it and you’re just reading ahead to get an idea about what to expect in Step 2, then I suggest you read the Study Schedule article we have prepared for Step 1 as well.</p><p>If you did poorly in the Step 1 test, there’s still hope for you so don’t worry. You still have Step 2-CK to take. There’s still a chance to redeem yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, Step 2-CK is a Clinical Knowledge test and is typically taken on the third or fourth year of medical school. Just like the Step 1 test, it’s a multiple choice questionnaire that’s divided into different sections. However, the coverage is much broader and complex compared to the first exam. There will be more questions too. Step 2-CK has a total of 355 questions divided into 7 sections each of which not having no more than 45 items. Takers are also allowed a 45-minute food break and a 15-minute tutoring break. Instead of testing the student’s knowledge about medical facts and information, 2-CK is more focused on the student’s patient skills.</p><p>Aside from the know-how, medical professionals also need to know how to interact with patients appropriately. They should also be able to convey and create emphasis on important health topics like disease prevention and health promotion. If anything, a student’s ability to present himself in front of patients in a professional and calm manner is an attribute that is crucial to his or her practice in the future. It basically informs the higher-ups whether the examinee is capable of handling patients efficiently. Even if you are the smartest person in the world, you will still not be an effective doctor if you fail at communicating and dealing with patients.&nbsp;</p><p>The other section, Step 2-CS, is a test of Clinical Skills. It’s an evaluation of how you can perform common medical hands-on responsibilities such as talking with patients, taking records and current symptoms, conducting physical exams, and discussing results and findings with patients and colleagues. All these patient skills are necessary for any practicing doctor and the 2-CS performance evaluation exam simply makes sure that you have what it takes to fulfil the role. It’s basically a pass or fail test. Luckily, you are allowed to take it up to three times within a period of 12 months so it’s not like it’s the end of the world if you don’t pass on your initial try. Then again, taking the test too many times will not look good on your CVV at all and will probably hurt your application for residency.</p><p>Anyway, all that’s left is Step 3 after you’re done with all the other steps. We have a separate article for USMLE Step 3 so we won’t be talking about it here. What’s more important now is that you need to come up with a Study Schedule that will help you pass both 2-CS and 2-CK. To help you out, we thought of listing a few techniques that have worked for us in the past.</p><h3><strong>How To Create A Great USMLE Step 2 Study Schedule</strong></h3><h3><strong>Consider Both The 2-CK and 2-CS Test</strong></h3><p>The thing that you really have to remember about the USMLE Step 2 is that they have two different parts. You have the 2-CK test which is your knowledge of clinical facts and concepts and the 2-CS test that measures your clinical skills as a medical pro. Both tests are graded differently so you have to prepare for them appropriately as well. For the 2-CK test, you have to study as you would for the Step 1 exams. For 2-CS, you have to focus more on improving your hands-on performance. You have to learn the proper ways to conduct yourself in front of patients, how to communicate with them effectively, as well as the right way to perform physical examinations.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Carefully Select The Material To Cover</strong></h3><p>Compared to Step 1, you have more material to cover for the 2-CK exam. Let’s just say that you need to cover four years’ worth of subjects in medical school. However, since it’s focused more on clinical knowledge and not basic sciences, you can dedicate your review time on related subjects. Do your research and study the exam material from previous years. It should help you decide on which topics to cover and include in your study schedule.&nbsp;</p><span><img alt="" data-id="2087" width="889" data-init-width="1024" height="423" data-init-height="487" title="Study-Schedule-1" loading="lazy" src="//www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Study-Schedule-1-1024x487.jpg" data-width="889" data-height="423"></span><h3>Simulate The 2-CS Test With Colleagues/Classmates</h3><p>As for the 2-CS test, it would be best if you can simulate your clinical skills with fellow classmates or colleagues. You can also ask help from your seniors or students who’ve already taken the USMLE Step 2-CS exam. They should be able to provide you input on how you can successfully pass this part of the test. Also, learning becomes more fun when you’re with people who have similar goals.&nbsp;</p><h3>Consider One-on-one Tutorials</h3><p>If you’re having trouble with some subjects or you feel more comfortable seeking professional help, then you can always opt for USMLE Step 2 tutorial programs. You can ask us more about this, if you’d like. We cover a wide array of subjects and offer tailor-fit programs for med students who are about to take the USMLE test series. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Conduct Mock Tests</strong></h3><p>Lastly, you have to put your studying to the test every now and again. Aside from the materials to be covered, you have another notorious enemy: Time. You have to practice reading, understanding, and answering the test material before actually going into the real fight. Include mock testing dates on your study schedule. &nbsp;</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[I Failed USMLE Step 1: How to Get Back Up and Excel]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I failed <a href="http://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-tutoring-step-1/">USMLE Step 1</a>." These are words that you didn't want to utter. We understand your disappointment. However, we also want you to know that you are not alone. A few hundred students from America’s top medical schools <a href="https://www.usmle.org/performance-data/">fail</a> the Step 1 exam at every administration. Whether you are a MD or DO student from a US medical school, or an IMG: <strong>failure on the USMLE exam is not the end of the road</strong>. Be confident that you CAN and WILL get back up and succeed. However, you need a plan and a strategy to ensure that you are on track to pass AND conquer USMLE Step 1 this time around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to Improve USMLE Step 1 Results</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Over the last eight years, Medlearnity has helped hundreds of repeat test-takers on USMLE Step 1</strong>. We are extremely familiar with the disappointment that you feel. But, we also recognize that you have to be focused and strategic in the work that you need to do. This will ensure that your next attempt is exactly what you’d like it to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Your Immediate Next Steps</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, the technicalities. The passing score for the USMLE Step 1 is 194. The average score in 2018 was 230 with a standard deviation of 19. You can retake USMLE Step 1 up to six times. You can take Step 1 a maximum of three times within a 12-month period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your fourth and subsequent attempts must be at least 12 months after your first attempt. Also, they must be at least six months after your most recent attempt. This means that after your first failed attempt, you may retake the exam twice within one year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don’t pass on your third attempt, you will have to wait six months to retake the exam. Your fourth attempt must be more than a year after you first took USMLE Step 1. It’s important to keep these technicalities in mind as you plan your test prep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Contact Your Medical School</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should contact your medical school if you haven’t already. Each program has different policies and next steps for students who need to retake Step 1. You might need to meet with an administrator at your medical school. You may also be required to retake and pass your exam by a certain date. We have had many students in this situation. What you need more than anything is a <strong>SOLID PLAN OF ATTACK for your USMLE Step 1 retake</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below is some general testing advice for your retake. This advice comes straight from expert tutors who have helped students ace their USMLE Step 1 retake, with truly incredible success stories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to Prepare for USMLE Step 1</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Get Over the Emotional Hurdle and Increase Your Confidence</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is understandable that you might be disappointed or even embarrassed the thought of "I failed USMLE Step 1". But, this is not something that you should try to keep inside or hide from your family or friends. You should share the news with those close to you. Talking about your situation with loved ones will help you to feel emotionally lighter. Your family and friends will help you to <strong>keep things in perspective and provide encouragement </strong>for the long road ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Evaluate What You Did in Your Last Exam Sitting</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We don't want your thoughts to be dominated by: "I failed USMLE Step 1". Take some time to actually <strong>sit down and assess EXACTLY what you did to study last time</strong>. The best way to get over your "I failed USMLE Step 1" frame of mind is to be brutally honest with yourself. Evaluate the study materials that you used the last time around. Consider whether they fell short, or whether it was your use of them that fell short.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did you cover enough material? Did you go through all of <a href="https://www.uworld.com/">UWorld</a>? Also, did you conduct a thorough review of all the questions you got wrong during your prep? Do you understand exactly why you got them wrong? Do you think there was a problem in your test-taking skills? Or, did you suffer from test-taking anxiety and the pressure that comes with USMLE Step 1? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This is the most important part of your recovery because it helps you to understand where you may have gone wrong</strong>. And half the battle is acknowledging that doing the same thing the second time around isn’t going to work if it didn’t work the first time. Taking ownership of the situation you are in is going to help you conquer your USMLE Step 1 retake. Success really is within your control – as long as you are honest, forthcoming, and willing to be vulnerable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Take a NBME Self-Assessment Exam</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the most critical step in getting study prep going again. This assessment will help you to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Have a baseline to assess your progress as you continue studying;</li>
<li>Gauge how much time you need to reach your score goal;</li>
<li>Assess your weaknesses and show you what areas you need to focus on.</li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We suggest that you compare this NBME self-assessment score report with your official USMLE score report. You will then see if there are any patterns that jump out at you. This will be helpful as you decide what subjects and systems to prioritize as you study.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, don't be alarmed if you score 10-15 points lower than you did on your actual exam. By the time you take this assessment, it's been at least a few weeks since you last sat for USMLE Step 1, so this is to be expected. Nevertheless, <strong>taking this initial self-assessment will tell you where you stand. You will know what you need to work on going forward as you prep for your retake</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Don't Rush In Without a Solid Plan of Action</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take your time and do not hurry to do your next retake. For the past eight years, we've worked with hundreds of medical students who are retaking Step 1 on a second or third attempt. The BIGGEST mistake we have seen is rushing to do the next take without allowing enough time to prepare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We cannot stress this enough. <strong>You need to allow yourself the time to learn the right study methods to prepare for this exam. Ensure that you are maximizing your learning and knowledge retention</strong>. According to the 2018 NBME Administrations Performance Data on Step 1 repeat test-takers: 67% of US MD, 73% of DO and 44% of International Step 1 repeaters passed the exam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need to make sure that you are thoroughly reviewing every question you get wrong. Also, you need to understand exactly why the wrong answers are wrong and why the right answer is right. You need a structured plan of action. This plan means setting real goals for yourself every day and sticking to them. Once you can see your plan of action coming into fruition, THEN you can schedule your new USMLE Step 1 date with confidence. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Once you have scheduled your date, the wheels will start turning even faster</strong>.<strong> But, make sure that you continue to stick to your plan, stay focused, and get tutoring help when you need it</strong>. We've often had our students tell us how incredibly helpful it is to review questions with their tutor. <a href="http://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">A tutor</a> will tell you exactly where you are going wrong and how to work on targeting your weaknesses so that they don’t hinder you on test day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>When Should I Schedule My USMLE Step 1 Retake?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How much time will you need to prep, you ask? It depends on a lot of what we’ve already said. Once you evaluate what went wrong on your last take, you will probably be able to answer this better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important thing is to assess how much time you need to discover what went wrong in the first place. Do you need help with this? Please reach out and <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">our team</a> would be happy to help you troubleshoot. <strong>If you missed a lot of points from content, improving content mastery will be key. </strong>On the other hand, <strong>if you felt like you knew the core material well, then you have to see why your application of the content fell short</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe in an organic process where you attack your weaknesses and reassess your progress. So you should complete an <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-nbme-self-assessments/">NBME assessment every 1-3 weeks</a>. This is dependent on your anticipated test retake date and residency application timeline. Use these assessments to make sure you are addressing the fundamental issues you need to strengthen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Things to Consider When Scheduling Your USMLE Step 1 Retake</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below are some guidelines - that are to be used with caution. Choosing your new test date depends on your individual situation and target score, among other factors. <strong>We often witness sudden shifts (i.e. from a 170 to a 200) after addressing core issues with test-taking. So also keep that in mind when considering these guidelines.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>A Score of 180+</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need an additional 4-5 weeks of dedicated study. Your medical knowledge is solid, but there are some gaping holes. And you need to target them and work through them so that they do not hinder you on exam day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>A Score in the 170s</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need about 6-7 weeks of additional dedicated study time. Your score reflects a weak foundation - nothing that can’t be worked on with some solid study time. But, you need to make sure that you are making steps towards targeting the right subject areas and systems, and that you have some expert guidance from a tutor pointing you in the right direction. A tutor will help you to efficiently cover material that you need to know and retain to succeed on your retake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>A Score of 160 or Less</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need 10-12 weeks of dedicated study time. Your score reflects foundational weaknesses in knowledge. This requires a longer time for you to learn and retain effectively. <strong>While you shouldn’t be discouraged – you need to be honest with yourself.</strong> <strong>You also need to do a serious evaluation of what you need to fix</strong> – and take it head on. We strongly recommend that you seek out <a href="http://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">professional tutoring services</a> to make sure that you are on the right track.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>You Can Still Succeed in Your Medical Career!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you have a new take on: "I failed USMLE Step 1". The best thing you can do for yourself at this point is to get tutoring from professionals. These pro tutors will help you create a focused and structured plan of study. You deserve to have a team of expert tutors and doctors on your side.

		<title><![CDATA[How NBME Free Practice Exams Can Boost Your Test Prep]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seven NBME <strong>free</strong> practice exams are now available to help students work on applying their medical knowledge to practical clinical scenarios in test-taking form. These <strong>free NBME Self-Assessments are available through September 30, 2020. </strong>They are intended to help students continue to sharpen their knowledge during the <strong>testing delays arising from the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>NBME Free Self-Assessments: What's Included</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NBME Self-Assessments are geared towards evaluating your readiness for your USMLE Exams. They include the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Comprehensive Basic Science (CBSSA) Forms 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The CBSSA exams replicate the <a href="http://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-tutoring-step-1/">USMLE Step 1</a></strong>. The content on these exams consists of multiple-choice items based on information typically covered during basic science medical school courses. Note that <strong>five out of the seven free NBME Self-Assessments are for Step 1</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Considering the importance of your Step 1 score, make sure to <strong>use these exams wisely</strong>. You should thoroughly review each exam’s diagnostic feedback. You should understand the reasons for the correct response, as well as the incorrect options.  <strong>Make sure you can articulate a reason for why you are eliminating an answer choice</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Comprehensive Clinical Science (CCSSA) Form 7</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The CCSSA exams are similar to <a href="http://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">USMLE Step 2 CK</a></strong>. These exams are multiple-choice items based on information typically covered during core clinical clerkships. They also resemble material that showed up on your NBME Shelf exams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Comprehensive Clinical Medicine (CCMSA) Form 5</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The CCMSA content resembles that of <a href="http://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-3/">USMLE Step 3</a></strong>. Furthermore, it utilizes information that is typically covered in clinical encounters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to Use These Practice Exams for NBME</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After ordering any of the free Self-Assessments, <strong>you will have 90 days to complete it</strong>. Once you take a practice NBME, <strong>you will have unlimited access to your interactive score report on MyNBME. You will also have the option to review each question, option set, and correct answer</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure that you are using this review process in the right way. Really try to understand why each wrong answer is wrong, and why the right answer is right. Before making the decision to eliminate an answer choice, you should be able to state why it isn’t the correct answer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Take the time to focus on why you may have gotten a question wrong</strong>. Every student has test-taking patterns and missteps, that when identified, can be instrumental in improving testing performance. Use the NBME’s diagnostic feedback, as it highlights your areas of strength and weakness. Then you'll be able to target your study plan going forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to Access These NBME Free Practice Exams</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To access these NBME Free Self-Assessments, go to <strong><a href="https://www.nbme.org/">MyNBME.org</a></strong> and follow the below instructions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(1) Enter your login information on the MyNBME sign-in screen that appears. If this is the first time you’re logging onto the site, you’ll need to select “First Time User”. You'll then be guided to set up an account in the system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(2) Once you are logged into NBME’s Homepage, <strong>use the “Product Search” to find the self-assessment that you’re looking for</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(3) Click on the name of the product, and <strong>select any form that is listed as “Free” </strong>– this includes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li><strong>USMLE Step 1</strong>: Comprehensive Basic Science (CBSSA) Forms 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19</li>
<li><strong>USMLE Step 2 CK</strong>: Comprehensive Clinical Science (CCSSA) Form 7</li>
<li><strong>USMLE Step 3</strong>: Comprehensive Clinical Medicine (CCMSA) Form 5</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(4) Choose your preferred pace for taking the exam: standard or self-paced</strong>. Even if you select self-paced, you should still set time restrictions to answer each question. You don’t want to completely remove yourself from the thought processes you will need to exercise in a time-sensitive, test-taking environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, you should see if you can still get the answer right without the EXACT time pressures that you will encounter on the day of the exam. Sometimes, it's nice to see whether you know the medical/clinical knowledge (and can recall that info with a little more time). Alternately, you may find that it is something you just don’t know. This would be a “blind spot” that you'll need to revisit and review during your test prep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(5) Click “Add to Cart” and then follow the on-screen prompts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Treat NBME Free Practice Exams Like Gold!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These <strong>NBME practice exams provide you with questions DIRECTLY from the test writers.</strong> This is truly like gold! You get to study each question, including the way that the test writers formulate patient scenarios; write correct answer choices (as well as the incorrect, trick answer choices).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These tests help you to get into the test writers’ heads! Understanding how they think and write can prepare you for how they will include irrelevant facts in the question. You'll also learn how they construct incorrect answer choices to try to stump you on test day. This will help you identify relevant facts in the questions with far more ease. Plus, it will prompt you to recognize wrong answer choices with more accuracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Take the NBME Practice Tests at the Beginning of Your Study Period</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Taking the NBME free practice exams at the start of your dedicated study period helps you to find out your baseline</strong>. Don’t stress if the score is lower than you would like it to be. This is to be expected, and it’s the reason why you have dedicated study period! Going forward, use NBME’s as a “check” on where you stand every few weeks. You'll be able to measure your learning and knowledge retention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>While NBMEs do not have explanations like UWorld, and it takes time to complete and review an NBME, it's still worth it. </strong>NBME is the best resource available that tells you exactly how you might perform on test day. So use it to your advantage to improve, re-tweak, and re-calibrate!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking an NBME Self-Assessment every few weeks will help make your study time more effective. It will also help to ensure that you are spending your time and energy in the right subject areas and topics. Use your diagnostic feedback report to re-tweak your study schedule and target your weaknesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Dedicate a Four-Hour Block for NBME Self-Assessments</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Setting aside this time to take your NBME free practice exams will be fruitful</strong>. You want to use this opportunity to recreate the testing experience for yourself. On test day, you will want your brain and body trained to withstand test-taking conditions. So why miss using an NBME free Self-Assessment? The best part with these practice exams, is that you build your testing prowess! You will get a three-digit score telling you exactly where you are in the study process. You can then use that score to direct and improve your study plan going forward, and reach your goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, you don't need to prepare for your USMLE exams alone. Our <a href="http://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">Medlearnity tutors</a> are available to assist you with your test prep. So, <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">reach out to us</a> and let's help you ace these exams!</p>

		<title><![CDATA[It's Exam Season! Things To Do Before Your USMLE Test]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The USMLE exams are an important part of your journey to become a medical doctor. Whether it's USMLE Step 1, USMLE Step 2, or USMLE Step 3, you are likely feeling a bit nervous - and that's normal. However, we want you to get past those feelings to actively plan and prepare to ace the test! Now let's consider some of the things you can do before your USMLE test to ensure your best performance.
<h2>How to Pass the USMLE Test</h2>
Before we get into the exam prep tips, let's quickly consider what you need to know about how to pass the USMLE test:
<h3>USMLE Step 1</h3>
<strong>The USMLE tests are structured differently and they have different passing scores</strong>. In the case of <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-1-percentiles/">USMLE Step 1</a>, there are 280 multiple-choice questions arranged into seven 60-minute blocks of 40 questions each. Although you'll get breaks, prepare yourself for a full day of testing! <strong>USMLE Step 1 tests your knowledge and application of core medical principles and mechanisms in diagnoses and treatment of diseases, as well as modes of therapy</strong>.

The <a href="https://www.usmle.org/transcripts/">passing score</a> for USMLE Step 1 is 194. But, you need to aim for a higher score, as your performance in this exam is very important for your choice of residency internship. We recommend aiming for a score of 240 or better. Yes, it's high, but you want to get into the best residency program. So maximize that score!
<h3>USMLE Step 2</h3>
Your USMLE Step 2 exam consists of Step 2 CS and Step 2 CK. The <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">USMLE Step 2 CS</a> is a one-day, 8-hour clinical skills exam. <strong>You'll investigate the complaints of a series of standardized patients (actors) and make appropriate recommendations. There will be 12 patient encounters and 15 minutes for you to assess each one.</strong> The good news? USMLE Step 2 CS is a pass/fail test.

USMLE Step 2 CK tests your application of medical knowledge and skills, as well as your understanding of clinical science. It assesses how well you can provide patient care under supervision and emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention. The USMLE Step 2 CK test consists of eight 60-minute blocks of 40 questions each (but the total number of multiple-choice questions will not exceed 318). <strong>USMLE Step 2 CK is more clinically-focused, and you need to have a firm grasp of  the principles in medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatry, as well as patient safety, legal/ethical issues, and professionalism.</strong>

A passing score for <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-2-percentiles/">USMLE Step 2 CK</a> is 209 and above. But, we don't want you to aim for a mere pass. A score of 250 and above puts you in a competitive position - especially if you're going to specialize in surgery. Let's aim for the stars with each of these tests!
<h3>USMLE Step 3</h3>
<a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-3/">USMLE Step 3</a> is the final milestone on your journey to medical practice without supervision. So if you're at Step 3, take a moment to celebrate your achievements thus far; you've come a long way!

You will likely take this USMLE test during your residency program. You will have many demands on your time as you juggle residency requirements, USMLE test prep, and your obligations. But, persevere! You're near the end and you can't give up now!

USMLE Step 3 is a two-day exam. <strong>The first day consists of six 60-minute blocks of 38-39 multiple choice questions (a total of 232 questions). These questions focus on the foundational sciences, biostatistics, interpretation of medical literature, patient safety, communication and interpersonal skills, and medical ethics</strong>.

Day 2 of USMLE Step 3 consists of six 45-minute blocks of 30 multiple choice questions each (180 questions in total). <strong>The emphasis will be on Advanced Clinical Medicine (ACM), patient diagnosis, and disease management. You'll also have 13 computer-based case simulations (CCS) that you'll need to complete in 10-20 minutes each. They will test your skills in patient diagnosis and disease management.</strong> So make sure that you're solid in your knowledge of patient history, physical examination, and use of diagnostic studies.

The passing score for <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-3-percentiles/">USMLE Step 3</a> is 198. But, you already know: don't aim for a mere pass. Aim for an excellent score to close out the USMLE exams in a spectacular way!
<h2>Quick Tips for USMLE Test Preparation</h2>
Now that you're clear on what each USMLE test entails, let's consider some useful tips that will help you to prepare and also perform at your best on your USMLE test day:
<h3>Get a Study Plan</h3>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-3003 size-large" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/study-1968077_1920-1024x682.jpg" alt="You need to have a study plan for your USMLE test. " width="1024" height="682" />

If you fail to plan, then you plan to fail. And we don't want you to fail; we want you to excel. The first step is to get a schedule in place. No, you won't study when you have time - we know what happens when you leave studying for your "free" time: it never happens!

We recommend that you <strong>create a study plan that specifies how much time you will spend reviewing your course materials and taking practice tests.</strong> <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/">Medlearnity</a> can help you optimize your study plan for the best results by offering expert tutoring that's aligned with the USMLE test.

Be sure to schedule break times, as well as time to socialize with your family and friends. Having regular breaks will help you to be more refreshed and far more productive in your study sessions.
<h3>Use Study Groups Wisely</h3>
Yes, you can join a study group to have a sense of community as you prepare for your USMLE test. But, beware! Your study group should cover all the material and not get bogged down in a set of topics that some persons may not understand. You want to have a group of persons with complementary strengths so that you can equally benefit from the group.

However, <strong>even if you are a part of a study group, you still need your solo study sessions</strong>. Set aside time to <strong>identify your strengths and weaknesses, and implement strategies to get better in understanding and applying the content</strong>.
<h3>Practice Makes Perfect: Utilize Question Banks</h3>
Each USMLE test is a marathon of sorts - you have a ton of questions to complete in a set time frame. So a key part of your preparation needs to include practice questions. We recommend that you <strong>complete as many questions as you can from the <a href="https://www.uworld.com/">UWorld</a> question bank for your test. If you exhaust that resource, then move on to the <a href="https://www.amboss.com/us">AMBOSS</a> question bank</strong>. Just keep practicing as much as you can!

However, here's a cautionary note: When you are completing these practice questions, make sure that you can justify your answers every time. You need to be clear on why each answer is correct, and also why the other options are incorrect. Go over your missed questions in detail to ensure that you understand where you made the error in your reasoning and answer choice.

<strong>Make sure that you are also timing yourself as you take these practice questions</strong>. The USMLE test will be timed, so you need to get in the habit of completing the questions following the same time blocks that you will encounter in the actual exam. That way, your USMLE test day will almost feel like another day in your study session!
<h3>Take NBME Self-Assessments</h3>
You want your study sessions to be effective, so that means that you need to objectively chart your progress. We recommend that you <strong>take an NBME self-assessment at the beginning of your study period</strong>. Yes, the score will likely not be great, but that's OK. You simply need to <strong>have a baseline score, an initial assessment of where you're starting from.</strong>

As you progress through your study sessions, continue to <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-nbme-self-assessments/">take these NBME practice exams</a>. Your scores will help you to identify your weak areas so that you can address them before your USMLE test date rolls around. Plus, you'll get extra motivation to study when you can see your progress from one self-assessment score to the next. Make sure that you're celebrating your small wins as you continue to prepare for your USMLE test.
<h3>Sleep! Seriously - You Need to Sleep</h3>
We know that you're studying a lot and you feel as though sleep is the last thing that you need. But, <strong>make sure that you're getting adequate sleep each night</strong> - it helps your brain function better and that makes for a better score on your USMLE test.

Try sitting in a comfortable position in a dimly-lit room. You can rest your eyes, or you can try reading a book (don't get on any screens though to avoid excessive stimulation). When you feel yourself drifting off to sleep, don't fight it.

You also want to <strong>get in the habit of sleeping at night</strong>. Why? Well, these USMLE exams tend to begin in the morning. So when you are well-rested, then you will experience more productive mornings as you study, and on the day of your USMLE test.
<h3>Simulate Your USMLE Test</h3>
You have studied and practiced as much as you can. Now, you also need to <strong>create the exam conditions at home and complete your USMLE test</strong> - before the actual exam. <strong>Complete two or more full-length USMLE tests</strong>, and be sure to incorporate all the breaks and snacks as well. You want to ensure that you are completely at home in the exam room for your actual test day so that you can focus on doing your best on the exam.
<h3>Plan for Your Test Day</h3>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-3005 size-large" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plan-2372176_1920-1024x682.jpg" alt="Plan for your USMLE test day." width="1024" height="682" />

You will likely need to travel to your test site. Make sure that you <strong>map out your travel route and time to avoid any problems with traffic and late arrival</strong>. Figure out all the parking details ahead of time as well. You can take a practice drive and park at the test center a few days before your USMLE test date. If possible, tour the test center and figure where the restrooms and other facilities are located. You don't want to waste valuable minutes on your test day.

Just before your test day, you will feel some anxiety - that's normal. <strong>On the day before your USMLE test, you can stop studying from in the afternoon. Simply relax and get yourself mentally ready for the next day</strong>.

If you're a breakfast person, make sure that <strong>you have a healthy breakfast - it's gonna be a long day! You also need to plan what snacks and lunch to take along with you on the day. Opt for easy, high-energy, and nutritious foods like granola bars and wraps.</strong> If you're a coffee person, have your supply on hand. Do whatever you need to do to be in the best physical, mental, and emotional state to ace your USMLE test!
<h3>Manage Your Breaks on Test Day</h3>
The adrenaline rush may tempt you to keep working at each block of questions without stopping. But, even then, breaks are useful. <strong>If you feel like taking a 30-second break while doing a block of questions, pause the test and take a quick breather. Calm yourself </strong>by taking deep breaths and counting backward from ten.<strong> Then, get back to the test</strong>.

Each USMLE test gives you a set number of minutes for your breaks and lunch. It's up to you how to use them. <strong>However, as a guide (and using USMLE Step 1 as an example) you can do the following</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Complete Blocks 1 and 2.</li>
 	<li>Take a 5-minute break.</li>
 	<li>Complete Blocks 3 and 4.</li>
 	<li>Take about 25 minutes for lunch. You can listen to some music and relax as you eat.</li>
 	<li>Complete Blocks 5 and 6.</li>
 	<li>Take another 5-minute break.</li>
 	<li>Complete Block 7.</li>
 	<li>Enjoy the remaining break time! You deserve it!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Don't Let the Unexpected Upset You</h3>
You have prepared as much as you could: but, sometimes life happens. You could forget an item at home, or you may be placed next to a fidgety (or sick) tester. <strong>Relax. It's OK. </strong> You may not have the perfect conditions for your test day, but that's fine. The main thing is to roll with the punches and not be fazed by anything. <strong>Focus on what you can to do: Complete your USMLE test to the best of your ability. Focus. Get it done. Be awesome in the face of it all!</strong>

		<title><![CDATA[How to Study for USMLE Step 1 and Score 250+]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[USMLE Step 1 is the first of three major exams that each student needs to complete to practice medicine. We understand that going into this exam can be nerve-wracking. But, don't be scared. Calm down, relax, get a plan in place, and execute that plan. Let's talk about how to study for USMLE Step 1 and get an excellent score: 250 and more. Yes, you can score 250 and above. It's possible - we'll show you how!
<h2>Take Your Pre-Clinical Work Seriously</h2>
<strong>Your pre-clinical coursework is quite important as you study for USMLE Step 1</strong>. You need to revise, understand, and integrate a lot of this content. Why? Because USMLE Step 1 is heavily focused on these subjects - physiology, pathophysiology, and microbiology. All medical principles build on each other, so you can't ignore any area! <strong>You must have a solid foundation when it comes to your core pre-clinical subject areas</strong>.
<h2>Set Up Your USMLE Step 1 Study Schedule</h2>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-3074 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/business-3054946_1920.jpg" alt="Establish your USMLE Step 1 study schedule. " width="1920" height="1440" />

You need to <strong>have a dedicated USMLE Step 1 study schedule</strong> to get the best out of your test prep. We recommend <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-1-study-schedule/">setting up a daily schedule</a> with <strong>dedicated blocks of time to study each subject area</strong>. Plan what material you will cover for every day of the week and at what time you will do so. Then, study according to that plan.

However, all work and no play is no fun at all! So don't just focus on studying all day - your brain will need a break. You can <strong>schedule regular break times to get a healthy snack, take a walk outdoors for some fresh air, or talk to your peers and family</strong>. Remember that balance is essential for your success.
<h2>Useful Resources As You Study for USMLE Step 1</h2>
A big part of the success of your study sessions relies on the resources that you use. There are <strong>several useful books that you can use as a resource</strong>. These include <em>First Aid for the USMLE Step 1</em>, <em>Kaplan USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes</em>, <em>Pathoma Fundamentals of Pathology</em>, among others. These books will help you to recall the core concepts and get a basic understanding of each, and also make associations across concepts.

Also, if you are an auditory learner, you may want to <strong>follow some online lectures</strong>. You can try out Pathoma, as well as the Kaplan online lectures. Listening to a lecture is a form of passive, but effective learning. So, if it suits you, then also listen to some lectures.

<strong>You need to get your UWorld Question Bank on board! No questions about it!</strong> <strong>Make sure that as you complete the questions that you can justify your answers.</strong> Also, <strong>when you miss questions, go over each one and be clear on why that particular response is the correct one, and why the other options are incorrect</strong>. This is not just about completing as many questions as possible but honing your skills as well. If you exhaust the UWorld question bank, then also try out the AMBOSS question bank. Just keep practicing!

The USMLE Step 1 exam is a timed one. So <strong>while you are completing these questions, make sure that you're timing yourself. You want to get in the habit of analyzing and answering the questions in exam-like conditions</strong>. That way, the test day will be a breeze for you!

<strong>Practice exams are another important resource. While UWorld also has self-assessments, you should also complete some NBME practice exams</strong>. We recommend that you <strong>take an NBME self-assessment at the start of your study program for USMLE Step 1</strong>. This will help to set the baseline for you to assess how well you are doing as you prepare for the exam. Yes, the score will probably not be the best, but don't worry. You just need a baseline because your study sessions are going to make you perform much better on the subsequent practice exams! Keep a positive outlook! We are going for 250 and above here!
<h2>How to Study for USMLE Step 1 in a Limited Time</h2>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-3071 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/time-2980690_1920.jpg" alt="You can complete your USMLE Step 1 study schedule in 6 weeks." width="1920" height="1280" />

Are you worried that you don't have enough time to study for your test? It's possible to have an effective <strong>USMLE Step 1 study schedule of 6 weeks</strong>.

You will need to <strong>study for 6 out of 7 days of the week</strong>. Also, you'll need to <strong>devote 12 or more hours per day to study</strong> for USMLE Step 1. In addition to using the recommended resources, you should also create flashcards. <strong>Flashcards are a great way to recall and practice a huge volume of content. Plus, the process of creating these cards helps you to not only review the materials but to focus on the most important principles</strong>.

<strong>Your mornings should be spent reviewing your textbooks on the subject areas you've designated to study for that week</strong>. Then, you can <strong>spend each afternoon completing your UWorld questions (aim for 40 to 80 questions each day). Complete them in a timed setting as well</strong>. You can create your flashcards as you review the concepts and after completing each block of questions.

<strong>In the late afternoon, you should review your missed questions in detail. Make sure that you understand why you got each answer wrong</strong>. It's important to hone your analytical skills so that you can perform at your best in the USMLE Step 1 exam. <strong>You can also review your flashcards before you go to bed each night</strong>. It will help to solidify the concepts in your mind.

You want to <strong>take two to three practice exams throughout these 6 weeks</strong>. Make sure that you complete your first baseline self-assessment during the first week. You should do your second practice exam in your third week - you need to track your progress. Then, you can take the third practice exam in your fifth or sixth week. In every instance, <strong>make sure that you take each practice exam under actual exam conditions</strong>.
<h2>How to Score High on USMLE Step 1: Test Day Tips</h2>
If you're going to conquer USMLE Step 1, then you must first know your opponent. The USMLE Step 1 exam is arranged in seven 60-minute blocks of 40 questions. As we stated before, you need to <strong>be an expert on all the pre-clinical subject areas - which you would have covered in your detailed study schedule and study sessions</strong>.

Please don't feel like you need to rush through each block of questions. <strong>Take your time to read and consider the options given for each question. Analyze each option and then select your best response</strong>. <strong>If you feel stressed at any point during a block of questions, take a quick 30-second break</strong>. Do some deep breathing, calm your mind, and then get back to the test.

You will have time allocated for breaks and lunch during your USMLE Step 1 exam. The great thing is that it's completely up to you to decide how to use the time. But, since we are the experts of all things USMLE exams and medical school, here's <strong>an example of how you can allocate your break time on your test day</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Complete Blocks 1 and 2.</li>
 	<li>Take a 5-minute break.</li>
 	<li>Then, complete Blocks 3 and 4.</li>
 	<li>You're halfway there! Take about 25-30 minutes for a quiet, relaxing lunch (listen to your favorite tunes).</li>
 	<li>Get back inside and complete Blocks 5 and 6.</li>
 	<li>Take another 5-minute break.</li>
 	<li>Finish the day in confidence as you complete Block 7.</li>
</ul>
There are <strong>other <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/things-to-do-before-your-usmle-test/">test day tips to keep in mind</a></strong>. You should:
<ul>
 	<li>Make sure that you're well-rested. A clear mind is critical for your exam success.</li>
 	<li>Resolve all travel routes and parking details a few days before your test day. You want to save all your energy for your exam.</li>
 	<li>If possible, map out the test venue. For example, it helps to know where all the restrooms are located.</li>
 	<li>Pack high-energy snacks and a quick, no-fuss, nutritious lunch (like a wrap or a sandwich).</li>
 	<li>If you're a coffee person, have lots of coffee on hand.</li>
 	<li>Don't analyze and worry about what you did in the previous blocks. Complete a block, forget about it, and keep moving forward. Your goal is to complete your exam in the best possible frame of mind and mental sharpness.</li>
 	<li>Yes, you tried to plan for everything - but don't be fazed by the unexpected. Keep calm and carry on!</li>

		<title><![CDATA[How to Score 280 on USMLE Step 2 CK: A Comprehensive Guide]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">A high score on <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">USMLE Step 2 CK</a> is probably the best boost you can give to your residency application. For those who didn’t score well on USMLE Step 1, a high Step 2 CK score is a chance to show residency programs what you’re capable of. Even if you scored well on Step 1, a strong performance on Step 2 CK demonstrates consistency and clinical excellence. Discovering the best strategies and planning how to study for Step 2 CK could be one of your highest-yield activities as you prepare to apply for residency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Step 2 CK has really taken on a new sense of importance. Many residency programs now require residency candidates to submit their Step 2 CK scores before ranking their applicants. </span><b>Moreover, the USMLE has announced that in 2022, Step 1 is scheduled to transition to a pass/fail metric – this change will place even more emphasis on your Step 2 CK score</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because Step 2 CK will still be a numerical score, it will be the quantitative criteria that residency admissions committees will use to select their top candidates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this comprehensive guide on how to score well on Step 2 CK, we share with you the advice of some of our Step 2 CK tutors who scored 279-281 on the exam. In working with hundreds of medical students over the years, we know that “one size” doesn’t fit all. So, we decided to get all of the best perspectives together, and compiled all of their best advice for you below!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our tutors provided advice on the most important Step 2 CK preparation starting points:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Use Clerkship Year to Set Yourself Up for Success</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Study for Step 2 CK</span></li>

</ul>
<h3><b>How to Use Clerkship Year to Set Yourself Up for Success</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking clerkship year and shelf exam prep seriously is important if you want to excel on Step 2 CK. You should see clerkship year as your opportunity to build a strong clinical foundation. Clerkship year prepares you for Step 2 CK because it gives you the chance to apply your medical knowledge to real, clinical scenarios -- an invaluable opportunity because Step 2 CK is a much more clinically focused exam than Step 1.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend that you start to use UWorld’s Step 2 CK question bank during clerkship year to prepare for shelf exams. This allows you to do your first pass of the question bank throughout the span of a year, and gives you early exposure to the style of questions that will be on Step 2 CK.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice and repetition are key. During your first pass through UWorld’s Step 2 CK question bank, we recommend using flashcards to document important concepts or points that you learned. Use Anki to make your flashcards – Anki’s spaced-repetition method is ideal for long-term learning and retention. Every flashcard you make should be concise and prompt a short, to-the-point answer. Be diligent, and keep up with making flashcards on concepts and points that you learn from practice questions – this will give you an extremely solid knowledge base for Step 2 CK.</span>
<h3><b>How to Study for Step 2 CK</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few different things we consider when advising students on how to study for Step 2 CK. Our advice depends on how much time you have, your baseline, and the score you’re aiming for. But every study strategy should be firm on a few things – yo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ur st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">udy approach and the resources you are going to use.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice questions are the most important part of Step 2 CK prep – we cannot emphasize that enough. Below, we get into more details on how to approach practice questions, but as a general matter, you should put a lot of your focus and energy into working through practice questions.</span>

<b>We recommend that you do two full passes through UWorld’s Step 2 CK question bank.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After your first complete pass through the question bank, do a quick take through all the questions to see which ones you got wrong or right. Identify weaknesses and high-yield topics that you struggled with, and work on solidifying your knowledge base in these areas. Then take a second pass through UWorld. After your second pass, you should go back and do a complete review, spending most of your time on the questions that you got wrong as well as the questions you are uncertain about but got right.</span>

<b>Your general study approach should focus on mastering the high-yield material first.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You know this content will definitely be tested on the exam, so allow yourself the time to review it first. This is an ideal strategy because it gives you the ability to identify weaknesses and knowledge gaps in high-yield information early on, and allows your brain the time to process through this high-yield information during the rest of your dedicated time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After you work through the high-yield material, use the next few weeks of your dedicated period to work through knowledge gaps that you identified, as well as detailed material that might be less high-yield but is fair game as far as what can be covered on the exam.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last few weeks of your dedicated study period, go back to the high-yield content that you worked through during your first few weeks. This allows you to reinforce and solidify all of the high-yield information that you already learned – and at this point, took the time to strengthen (especially as to weaknesses of yours that you discovered in high-yield material). Re-visiting this high-yield information is extremely important because the second time around, your brain will already have taken the time to process it, and you can continue to work through knowledge gaps and see how it all fits together.</span>

<b>In terms of the resources you should use to study, the optimal strategy is to use <a href="https://medical.uworld.com/usmle/usmle-step-2-ck/">UWorld</a> practice questions, with a text-based resource, and OnlineMedEd</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This resource strategy gives you the benefit of changing-up how you’re learning on a day-to-day basis. The audio-visual component of OnlineMedEd combines really well with a text-based resource, and UWorld practice questions help you to apply everything you’re learning. Other than practice questions, the resources you use to study is the most important component of your Step 2 CK prep. Check out our </span><a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/best-resources-for-step-2-ck-prep/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comprehensive Step 2 CK Resource Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you’re struggling with knowing which materials and resources to use.</span>

<b>Because practice questions are so critical to effective Step 2 CK prep, make sure that you are using your UWorld question bank in a way that most closely replicates real-time exam conditions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means using timed-mode and using randomized, mixed blocks as you get more familiar with Step 2 CK style questions. </span><b>Initially, you will want to do subject-specific blocks to get familiar with and master the concepts that are tested in each subject area, but later on, you should transition to randomized, mixed blocks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Using too many subject-specific blocks during your prep will give you far more comfort than you’ll have on test day. You will need to train your brain to do the mental acrobatics needed to quickly switch from one subject area to another, within timed constraints.</span>
<h3><b>Additional Resources for Practice Questions</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While the go-to question bank for Step 2 CK is UWorld, you shouldn’t hesitate to consult other sources. </span><b>If you have already gone through the UWorld question bank twice, then definitely seek out other resources for practice questions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You don’t want to get too comfortable with the same material – questions are supposed to get your brain thinking hard the way you will have to on exam day.</span>

<b>We highly recommend <a href="https://www.amboss.com/us">Amboss</a></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has a large question bank with an excellent library feature that breaks down the topics covered by each question. The answer explanations that Amboss provides are excellent – and they are easily searchable at any time. One of the best parts of doing practice questions is how much you learn from the answer explanations – and having the explanations so easily accessible is a huge advantage of Amboss.</span>

<b>OnlineMedEd is also another source of practice questions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The OnlineMedEd practice questions are more focused on the basics of high-yield information that can be tested on Step 2 CK. It’s a great question bank to use if you have already exhausted UWorld and Amboss, and/or if you want to answer questions that focus on the fundamental basics and identifying whether or not you’ve mastered them.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Always Check Your Progress</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-nbme-self-assessments/">NBME Self-Assessments</a> are the best way to track your progress. We recommend that you take one a few weeks before the end of M3 to get a baseline score. As you work through UWorld practice questions and other resources such as textbooks and OnlineMedEd (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out our guide on Step 2 CK Resources</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">), use NBMEs as a check on where you stand every few weeks.</span>

<b>Craft yourself a study schedule where you evenly space out NBMEs, giving yourself almost equal time, say 3 weeks, in between each one</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After each NBME, review each question and make sure you can articulate WHY the correct choice is the best answer. You should also have a strong intuition for why the incorrect choices do not work. Taking an NBME Self-Assessment every few weeks during your dedicated period allows you to periodically replicate the length of a real-time exam, which can help you to identify your weaknesses quickly, and make your study time more efficient. Check out some of our tips </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-nbme-self-assessments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to use NBME Self-Assessments</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Reviewing NBME exams can be challenging given the lack of explanations -- this is where tutoring can be extremely valuable, as we have expertise in guiding you through where you went wrong.</span>
<h3><b>How Long Should You Study for Step 2 CK</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer to this question depends on a lot of factors – the most important being, your knowledge baseline, and the amount of dedicated time you have.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be diligent, and use your clerkship year and <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/nbme-shelf-exams/">shelf exam prep</a> to set yourself up for success. And if you are aiming for a competitive score, it is extremely important to have a dedicated study period with no other distractions or time sinks. You need this dedicated time to zero in on Step 2 CK prep and consolidate everything that you know and identify the material you need to review.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly how much-dedicated study time you need depends on how far out you are from core clinical rotations (is your knowledge recent or is it rusty?) and how you scored on Step 1. There are a variety of factors at play here, but </span><b>generally, we recommend a dedicated period of at least 4 weeks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><b>Scheduling Your Step 2 CK Exam</b></h3>
<b>You should ideally take Step 2 CK within 6-7 months of finishing your core clinical rotations </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(however we realize this is not always possible for IMG students or students with unique circumstances)</span><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We recommend this because you will just recently have covered Step 2 CK material during your clinical rotations and shelf exam prep. So, your Step 2 CK knowledge base will be recent, activated, and ready to grow!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re struggling with setting up a Step 2 CK study schedule or looking for general Step 2 CK study strategy advice, </span><a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/"><strong>set up a trial session with our Step 2 CK team</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – we would be happy to help!</span>

		<title><![CDATA[The Best Resources for Step 2 CK Preparation]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students often ask us our advice on what the best resources are for USMLE Step 2 CK preparation, especially because Step 2 CK doesn’t have a go-to resource the way USMLE Step 1 does with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Aid</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We also know that there are a lot of resources available for Step 2 CK preparation – the sheer number and volume of what’s available can be overwhelming. </span><b>To help you prep for Step 2 CK, we compiled together the resource advice of some of our tutors who scored 279-281 on Step 2 CK</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of practice questions and supplementary resources is <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-score-280-on-usmle-step-2-ck/">key for Step 2 CK preparation</a>. </span><b>What are the resources you can use to help you excel on Step 2 CK?</b>
<h2><b>UWorld For Step 2 CK</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the best resource for Step 2 CK out there. The UWorld vignettes for <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">Step 2 CK</a> are very similar to the length of the actual questions on the exam and the difficulty of the questions is also similar to what you will encounter on test day.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest difference between Step 1 and Step 2 CK questions is that Step 2 CK questions require you to think like a physician – the questions really test your ability to apply your medical knowledge practically and reach a clinical diagnosis or management decision. Questions often make you work through an important differential – you need to be able to confidently narrow in on the diagnosis, and then decide the next step in management, whether that be a diagnostic option or therapeutic intervention. This emphasis on management decision-making is a key component that differentiates Step 2 CK from Step 1.</span>
<h3><b>How to Use UWorld for Step 2 CK:</b></h3>
<h4><b>Try to do UWorld a solid TWO passes before your exam</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Set a goal of going through the question bank twice. After your first complete pass through the question bank, identify topics that are high-yield and areas that you are weak on. Take a few weeks to address your weaknesses and sharpen your knowledge base, with an emphasis on topics where you struggled. Then take a second pass through UWorld. On your second pass, solidify high-yield topics and pay particular attention to questions that you got incorrect. Since this is your second pass through the question bank, incorrect questions are particularly revealing – and you should emphasize these areas in your studying.</span>
<h4><b>Begin with subject-specific blocks but then transition to randomized, mixed blocks.</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3128 alignright" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1751603756-1-300x200.jpg" alt="Med Student Studying for Step 2 CK" width="300" height="200" />You want to replicate real test-taking conditions when using UWorld – and to do this effectively, you will want to avoid getting too comfortable with subject-specific blocks. We recommend that you initially </span><b>begin with subject-specific blocks, and then transition to randomized, mixed blocks as you get more comfortable with concepts tested in specific subject areas</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You want your brain to practice the kind of quick thinking and subject-switching you will have to do on test day. On test day, you might have to do a psychiatry question followed by cardiology and then pediatrics – but your brain needs to do the work of first identifying which question-type you are in, and then identifying all the relevant information in that specific subject that you need to answer the question in front of you. To practice answering questions actively and as close to exam day as possible, start using randomized, mixed blocks</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">– especially as you get closer to test day.</span>
<h4><b>Utilize timed mode.</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because you want to replicate the exam day as closely as possible, you should be very diligent in making sure to answer your questions in timed mode. </span><b>Step 2 CK questions are much longer than what you encountered on Step 1 – not only are the vignettes a lot longer in length but working through the answer choices takes a lot more time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Using timed mode consistently and regularly will ensure that there are no drastic surprises on test day. Timed mode also allows you to uncover subject area weaknesses that you may not have been aware you had.</span>
<h2><b>OnlineMedEd for Step 2 CK</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">OnlineMedEd is a fantastic resource that does a great job of covering high-yield material for Step 2 CK in an easy-to-use platform. It has videos, notes, practice questions and flashcards. The lectures and the notes are the most high-yield and best use of OnlineMedEd.</span>

<b>Use your UWorld practice sets to guide your use of OnlineMedEd</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In doing UWorld practice questions, you should be consistently identifying topics that you are struggling with – then go to OnlineMedEd and watch the lecture videos for the topics that you struggled with. The lecture videos are fairly short and break down complex medical concepts in an easy to understand way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The notes that accompany lecture videos are excellent. Once you watch the lecture video, we recommend placing more emphasis on the notes – because watching videos is often a passive activity, and the notes will be sure to cover and focus on the most high-yield and important parts of the lecture video and overall medical concept. </span><b>In reading through these notes, taking time to internalize the information – first, read through the material carefully, then close your eyes and see if you can recall and re-state or re-explain what you just read</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h2><b>The Best Text-based Resources for Step 2 CK</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The optimal resource strategy is to use UWorld practice questions, with a text resource and OnlineMedEd. Having a go-to text during your prep is extremely helpful.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, using a text resource like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master the Boards</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with both OnlineMedEd and UWorld practice questions also gives you the benefit of changing-up how you’re learning on a day-to-day basis. The audio-visual video component of Online Med Ed combines really well with a text resource and practice questions from UWorld to help you apply everything you’re learning.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, our tutors who have <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-score-280-on-usmle-step-2-ck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scored 279-281 on Step 2</a> CK provide their thoughts on the most commonly used text-based resources.</span>
<h2><b>Master The Boards for Step 2 CK</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there’s no gold standard textbook resource for Step 2 CK, the next best textbook resource for Step 2 CK is Conrad Fischer’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master the Boards</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a 700-page user-friendly text that highlights the most important material and presents all information in a step-by-step approach.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend combining </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master the Boards</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with <a href="https://www.uworld.com/">UWorld</a> practice questions – in our experience tutoring students, we have found that these two resources work well together to supplement each other – each resource fills in the blanks and details that the other resource may have left out. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master the Boards</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not all-inclusive though, and that’s why combining both </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master the Boards</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and UWorld practice questions </span><b>WITH</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> OnlineMedEd is an excellent strategy to make sure you are covering everything, and especially making sure you master high-yield content. <a href="https://www.amboss.com/us">AMBOSS</a> is another resource that can be helpful, with an extensive question bank.</span>
<h2><b>Step Up To Step 2</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen that this text really works well for some students, but it depends on your learning style and whether you prefer traditionally formatted textbooks. The chapters in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Up to Step 2 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are short and efficient, and all information is presented in bullet-point format.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bullet-point format makes it so that students don’t get dragged into details and can ensure that they have all the high-yield information for each subject. However, if you’re finding that you are particularly weak in a specific subject, we recommend that you seek out additional resources that cover the material in more depth – whether that be OnlineMedEd, or another text like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master the Boards</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We often recommend that students use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Up to Step 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a review text to ensure that they know and have mastered all the high-yield information of each subject – the bullet-point format of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Up to Step 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is highly accessible and makes this really easy to do.</span>
<h2><b>Step Up to Medicine</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the go-to text for content on internal medicine, family medicine, neurology, ambulatory medicine, and surgery. And it breaks all the information down in a step-by-step approach, from recognizing the symptoms, to arriving at a differential diagnosis, and deciding on a diagnostic work up and/or treatment option – which is exactly how you need to approach questions on <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">Step 2 CK</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Up to Medicine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not an all-inclusive text. It doesn’t include Ob/Gyn, Pediatrics or Psychiatry – so you will still need to consult other resources for those subjects.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s still an excellent in-depth and comprehensive resource for the subjects that it does cover, and students should use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Up to Medicine </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a resource especially if they have identified any of the subject areas it covers as a weakness.</span>
<h2><b>First Aid for Step 2 CK</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is your traditional review book resource – it’s super comprehensive, presented in a book-like format (no bullet-points), and each section covers all the details relevant to the subject or topic being discussed. If you decide to use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Aid for Step 2 CK</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you won’t really need another text-based resource to turn to, because it truly covers everything.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we recommend that in addition to using </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Aid for Step 2 CK</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you also consider consulting texts like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Up to Step 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because its emphasis on high-yield content through bullet-point format can help you to quickly and efficiently ensure that you have mastered all the high-yield content on each topic. </span><b>You can do a run-through of </b><b><i>Step Up to Step 2 </i></b><b>on a particular subject or topic after you read through its more comprehensive counterpart in </b><b><i>First Aid for Step 2 CK</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Don’t get bogged down in all the level of detail that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Aid for Step 2 CK</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides, though. It’s an extremely helpful resource, but don’t spend precious hours of your dedicated time memorizing low-yield, high-detail content.</span>

<b>The best method of using </b><b><i>First Aid for Step 2 CK </i></b><b>is to begin with the subject or topic areas that are your biggest weaknesses, and then to move onto the others</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As already recommended, mix up your use of resources by using audio-visual resources like OnlineMedEd, and of course lots of UWorld practice questions!</span>
<h2><b>Step 2 Secrets</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We think this is an excellent resource to use as an overall review towards the end of your Step 2 CK prep. It’s in question-and-answer format, and it’s a quick read (only about 300 pages) – so it’s a great way to test yourself in a fast and efficient way to make sure you know most of the high-yield content for Step 2 CK. </span><b>In making the best use of the question-and-answer format, we recommend that after you read the question – pause, close your eyes, and take the time to answer what’s being asked before rushing to look at the answers </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a great strategy for test-taking in general!).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Good luck on your Step 2 CK prep, and don’t hesitate to </span><a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set up a trial session with our Step 2 CK team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you need advice on preparing for your exam – we would be happy to help!</span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[How to Write a Great Personal Statement for Residency]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>7 tips to help you write your personal statement for residency and improve your chances of landing your dream program</h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3118 alignleft" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1750963505-2-300x200.jpg" alt="Medical student surrounded by books, writing his personal statement for residency." width="300" height="200" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you prepare to leave medical school and move on to the next stage of your medical career, the thought of residency applications will likely take up a significant amount of your attention. Among the factors you’ll need to consider is your residency personal statement. Sitting in front of a blank page, trying to get started with writing, can be one the most daunting parts of the whole residency application process.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a process to help guide you can be a huge help. If you’re ready to start writing your residency personal statement, here are a few tips that might be of use.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Give yourself plenty of time</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling rushed will make the writing process much harder and more stressful than it needs to be. You’ll be opening your <a href="https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-residency/article/register-myeras-residency/">ERAS profile</a> in July of your final year of medical school, and sending your applications in September; ideally, you should consider beginning to work on your personal statement by around February. This will allow you enough time to write a draft, get feedback from people you trust, and revise it until you feel great about it.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Focus your writing</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that your personal statement has a purpose – you want to explain to residency programs why you’d be a great fit for them. Try to focus your writing around these ideas:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why you’ve selected this specialty, and what makes you a great fit for it. Think about your personality traits and interests, and how they fit into this field of medicine. Don’t spend time discussing why you went to medical school in the first place; instead, focus on why you’ve chosen this particular specialty.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you bring to the table for a residency program. Help the program to understand why they would want to select you over others. Ideally, you should include specific examples of your skills in action.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you’re looking for in a residency program. For example, is it important to you to have research opportunities? A smaller program with a close group of residents, or a larger program with more diverse opportunities? Opportunities to work with particular patient populations? Help the residency program to understand why they’re the right fit for you, not just the other way around.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your vision for your future career after residency. Are there any particular patient populations that you’d like to serve? Do you hope to work in an inpatient or an outpatient setting, or a mix of both? Would you like to incorporate research and/or teaching into your career? Do you plan to pursue a fellowship in a particular subspecialty? Help the residency program to understand your long-term goals.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by writing about these topics. Once you’ve gotten your ideas down on paper, then you can find a way to tie them together. You may notice a particular theme emerging; you can then create an introduction and a conclusion that relate to that theme. For example, starting with an interesting anecdote can be a great way to gain the reader’s attention.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Keep it brief</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a limited amount of space in which to write your personal statement. ERAS gives you 3500 characters (including spaces), which is approximately one single-spaced page of writing. This doesn’t give you enough space to go into your entire life story. It’s important that you consider carefully what needs to be included and what you can leave out.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that the admissions committee already has your CV, so there’s no need to try to include everything you’ve done during medical school in your personal statement. Use this as an opportunity to highlight the most important features and give a sense of yourself as a person, rather than trying to restate your CV.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Use storytelling</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind the writing axiom, “Show, don’t tell.” People enjoy and remember stories much more easily than concepts or facts. Try to include some anecdotes to give your personal statement life. For example, you might include the story of a patient who deeply affected you (while protecting that person’s confidentiality, of course!), of how you learned a valuable lesson on the wards, or of a time when you displayed a particular skill that will be useful in your residency. It doesn’t even have to be a story from medical school; you could talk about an experience with a friend or family member’s illness, or tell a story from another part of your life. If the story has an emotional impact (perhaps it’s funny or poignant), then it will be even more memorable. The stories in your personal statement can also serve as a great starting point for conversations during your residency interviews!</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Be creative</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The directors of a residency program will be reading a large number of personal statements as they consider applicants for the next residency class. It’s inevitable that a lot of those personal statements will start to sound the same after a while. Ideally, try to make yours stand out from the crowd. Perhaps you have a unique story to tell, or a funny anecdote to open with. You’ll want to ensure that you include all of the relevant information, but don’t be afraid of a little creativity.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Use your unique voice</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that your personal statement is meant to be a chance for a residency program to get to know you. The right residency program for you is the one where you best fit in. Don’t try to inflate your accomplishments, or to say only what you believe the program wants to hear. The more you stick to telling the honest truth about yourself, your experiences, and your desires, the more likely you are to end up matching with a program that you truly love. Have fun with the process of writing, and remember that the personal statement is just one component of your residency application.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Seek feedback</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In writing as in many other endeavors, feedback is crucial. Seek as many opportunities for feedback as you possibly can. Send your personal statement to your trusted mentors, and ask whether they have any specific suggestions. Try asking a few of your medical school colleagues for feedback as well; you can trade personal statements and give each other suggestions. Ask for specific positive as well as negative feedback, so that you know what’s working well and what may need to be revised. The more pairs of eyes you can get on your personal statement before you submit it in ERAS, the better.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may want to consider seeking professional feedback as well. Sending your personal statement to a professional for a consultation can work wonders in terms of helping you to hone your writing and ensure that you’re sending the right message. These specialists can also help you with other aspects of your application, including helping you to study efficiently for the USMLE so that you get the highest possible scores on Steps 1 and 2. Professional assistance with your residency application could be the key to landing a spot in your dream program.</span>

		<title><![CDATA[How to Study for Your Third Year Shelf Exams]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Third year rotations present unique challenges. While the first two years of medical school are certainly demanding, they are in some ways a more intensive extension of your undergraduate experience: go to class, take notes, study really hard, take exams, and then put it all together to ace USMLE Step 1. Third year of medical school, though, brings a whole new dimension to the medical school experience.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your core clerkship rotations demand intensive time commitment – ten to twelve-hour days that require you to always be “on” so can succeed on the wards by showing attendings and residents your knowledge, preparedness, and willingness to learn. By the time you get home, studying for your NBME Shelf Exams is the last thing you want to do. That’s why you need a plan in place for to study for your third year shelf exams. It will be much easier to stick to a schedule and follow a regime if you’ve already set out exactly what you’re going to do for each rotation and its shelf exam ahead of time.</span>

<img class="wp-image-3128  aligncenter" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1751603756-1-300x200.jpg" alt="Med Student Studying for Third Year Shelf Exams or Studying for Step 2 CK" width="483" height="322" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some useful tips and information to help you excel on your NBME Shelf Exams:</span>
<h2><strong>What are Shelf Exams?</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The NBME Shelf Exams are administered at the end of certain third-year rotations: </span><b>(1) Medicine, (2) Family Medicine, (3) Neurology, (4) Ob/Gyn, (5) Pediatrics, (6) Psychiatry, and (7) Surgery</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The questions on shelf exams are made up of retired USMLE questions that have been “shelved,” meaning they are no longer used on USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK exams. Many questions that you will see on the shelf exams will be VERY similar to what you saw on Step 1 and what you will see on Step 2 CK.</span>

<b>Each shelf exam has 110 multiple-choice questions, and is 2 hours and 45 minutes long. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every shelf exam is computer-based and is administered using NBME’s portal. Depending on the shelf exam, you will either take it at your institution or at a Prometric center.</span>
<h2><strong>Why are Shelf Exams Important?</strong></h2>
<b>There are two main reasons why your shelf exams are important: (1) Clerkship Grades and (2) Step 2 CK Preparation. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your shelf exam score is used to calculate your grade for each clerkship. Depending on how your medical school determines final grades for each clerkship, how well you do on the shelf exam can have a large impact on your final grade. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if your medical school does something like 60% clinical performance and 40% shelf exam score, then how well you do on the shelf exam can have a large impact on your final grade. Moreover, your shelf exam performance is the most objective control you have over your final clerkship grade since there are many subjective variables to how attendings and residents evaluate your clinical performance on each rotation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more diligently you study for shelf exams, the better off you’ll be when you sit down to prepare for Step 2 CK. The material covered during clinical rotations and shelf exam prep is the same material you need to master for Step 2 CK. So the studying that you do for your shelf exams will pay off big time when you start to prep for Step 2 CK.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, shelf exam prep and Step 2 CK prep are so interconnected that we recommend you use UWorld’s Step 2 CK question bank throughout clerkship year to prepare for each shelf exam. (For tips on how to do well on Step 2 CK, check out our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comprehensive Step 2 CK Study Guide!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). At the end of third year, reset UWorld’s question bank so you can use it to study for Step 2 CK.</span>
<h2><strong>How to Study for Your Third Year Shelf Exams</strong></h2>
<b>How should you study for your third year NBME Shelf Exams?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The two most important steps you can take to ensure you are studying effectively for your shelf exams are: (1) create a study schedule and be diligent about studying during each rotation, and (2) decide which resources you’re going to use to study for each shelf exam. </span>

<b>Your study strategy for shelf exams should generally be – daily reading and practice questions, plus 1-2 NBME practice exams about 1-2 weeks before the shelf exam</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><strong>1. Create a Study Schedule</strong></h3>
<b>Make a study schedule that will help you stay on track, despite the ups-and-downs that come with rotations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is totally understandable (and expected) that you’re going to be exhausted after spending long hours in the wards. When you finally make it home after a long day, you will be tempted to just change out of your scrubs, eat food and watch Netflix. But you need to avoid falling into this pattern. It will leave you scrambling the last week of your rotation.</span>

<b>Get a calendar and count up how many days you have until the shelf exam</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the start of each rotation, identify the resources you want to use to study and divide the number of pages to read and/or the number of questions to work through by the number of days available for studying. This gives you a structured schedule and a daily goal to work towards. It spaces out the material you need to cover as well as the practice questions you need to complete and review. When the time comes for you to take your shelf exam at the end of each rotation, you will be fully prepared!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you sit down to map out your study schedule for each shelf exam, be honest with yourself in acknowledging the days you won’t be able to study. If you know you’ll be attending a family get-together or a friend’s birthday celebration, build that into your schedule. This will help ensure that you are creating a schedule that you can actually stick to.</span>

<b>Plan to leave a few days before the shelf exam for dedicated studying</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Try to leave the 2-3 days right before the shelf exam for dedicated studying. Use this time to review the material and practice questions you’ve covered over the past few weeks. </span>

<b>Take at least one NBME for each rotation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We recommend that you try to take an NBME practice test 1-2 weeks before you take the shelf exam – this will help to put you in test-taking mode, give you more material to review, and identify your topic-area weaknesses.</span>

<b>Make studying a daily habit. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a schedule and sticking to a plan will help you avoid last-minute cramming and alleviate unnecessary stress and anxiety. Be diligent – make it a goal to study every day for a set amount of time. Even if you don’t have time to hit your goal on a particular day, you should still sit down to study and chip away at your goal as much as you can – even one solid hour of studying is better than no studying at all. Cultivate a daily habit of studying and solidify a routine throughout your clerkship year. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your consistency will add up in the long run. Not only will you avoid last-minute cramming, but you will achieve deeper content-mastery because you are giving your brain the space and time to process information over the course of your rotation. Your diligence will pay off big time in both your shelf exam performance and Step 2 CK score.</span>
<h3><strong>2. Decide Which Resources to Use</strong></h3>
<b>We recommend using UWorld and OnlineMedEd as a resource for every rotation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. UWorld’s Step 2 CK question bank is the best resource for shelf exam practice questions. Use UWorld for every rotation, and at the end of third year, reset the question bank and use it for Step 2 CK. Make sure to thoroughly review answer explanations – that’s where much of the learning happens!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">OnlineMedEd videos do an excellent job of breaking down complex concepts, and you can easily access rotation-specific material by searching the Library. Many students find OnlineMedEd videos helpful to use as a primer before they begin their rotation and also as a resource for high-yield review 1-2 weeks before the shelf exam.</span>

<a href="https://www.amboss.com/us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMBOSS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great tool both for use on the wards and for studying for your exams. It includes a huge database of evidence-based guidelines, along with a question bank containing thousands of exam-like practice questions. What makes AMBOSS a go-to study resource is that everything is connected across the platform, helping to unify and solidify your knowledge base as well as prepare you for exams.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another great resource is the </span><a href="https://divineinterventionpodcasts.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divine Intervention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcasts. This is an ongoing series of reviews on high-yield topics, which can help you on your shelf exams as well as USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK. You can look through 250+ episodes to find the ones relevant to your current clerkship. The podcast format is especially useful for those extra spaces of time that would otherwise be hard to use for studying, such as your commute time or workout time.</span>

<b>For each rotation, you will need a text-based resource</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can serve as your go-to reference. A text resource can supplement practice questions and help you strengthen any subject area weaknesses. Here are some resource recommendations for each rotation:</span>
<h4><b>Medicine</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In comparison to the Family Medicine Shelf, the Medicine Shelf places more emphasis on understanding the pathophysiology of conditions that affect different organ systems. The Medicine Shelf will require you to establish a diagnosis and recommend appropriate diagnostic or treatment options.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">UWorld Medicine is the best resource to study for the Medicine Shelf Exam. Although it will take several weeks to complete, it’s definitely worth it! There are currently over 1400 medicine questions; if you have a typical medicine rotation (8-12 weeks), you should aim to finish all the questions by week 6.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">UWorld Medicine is really the gold standard resource here – the amount of content it covers, together with its answer explanations provide a fantastic resource for the Medicine Shelf Exam.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Step-Up-Medicine-Dr-Steven-Agabegi/dp/1975103610/ref=pd_bxgy_img_3/143-9336013-5986046?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1975103610&amp;pd_rd_r=14675255-8b4c-481d-8a2a-f7770ef0992d&amp;pd_rd_w=nqLWQ&amp;pd_rd_wg=4qtwH&amp;pf_rd_p=ce6c479b-ef53-49a6-845b-bbbf35c28dd3&amp;pf_rd_r=Z6Z7RF3BR04J4XJHSM7M&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=Z6Z7RF3BR04J4XJHSM7M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Up to Medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the best text-based resource for Medicine, in our opinion. It is comprehensive and thorough, and an all-around excellent resource to serve as a supplement to your UWorld Medicine practice questions. Some students might find it to be a little longer than they’d like, but the depth of information it provides is second to none, especially if you consider Medicine to be one of your weaker subject areas.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Files-Internal-Medicine-Fifth-LANGE/dp/0071843353/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Case+Files+Internal+Medicine&amp;qid=1595562382&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case Files Internal Medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great resource too – it provides 60 clinical cases, each with shelf exam style questions designed to illustrate fundamental concepts in Medicine. It’s also a lot shorter than Step Up to Medicine and focuses more on high-yield material.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.uptodate.com/home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UpToDate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is excellent in general, and especially for Medicine. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Many students also like to use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Medicine-Dr-Marc-Sabatine/dp/1975142373/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Pocket+Medicine&amp;qid=1595562771&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">Pocket Medicine</a>, especially during the wards (when access to electronics is limited).</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Family Medicine</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be a little difficult to know how to use UWorld to prepare for the Family Medicine Shelf Exam since Family Medicine covers a broad scope of material. Content-wise, a lot of things are fair game for the Family Medicine Shelf – questions can range from pregnancy to child developmental milestones and puberty, to age-related diseases. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In comparison to the Medicine Shelf Exam, the Family Medicine Shelf Exam places more emphasis on the course of a person’s development, from childhood to adulthood to old age.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Case+Files+Family+Medicine%2C+Fourth+Edition&amp;i=stripbooks&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case Files Family Medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does a great job covering the basics. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blueprints-Family-Medicine-Mitchell-King/dp/1496377885/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3TW00VV8CCCET&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=blueprints+family+medicine&amp;qid=1595560108&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=Blueprints+F%2Cstripbooks%2C193&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blueprints FM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a great study resource. It’s concise and has a well-organized format; it’s best used as a high-level/overview text.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Step-Up-Medicine-Dr-Steven-Agabegi/dp/1975103610/ref=pd_bxgy_img_3/143-9336013-5986046?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1975103610&amp;pd_rd_r=14675255-8b4c-481d-8a2a-f7770ef0992d&amp;pd_rd_w=nqLWQ&amp;pd_rd_wg=4qtwH&amp;pf_rd_p=ce6c479b-ef53-49a6-845b-bbbf35c28dd3&amp;pf_rd_r=Z6Z7RF3BR04J4XJHSM7M&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=Z6Z7RF3BR04J4XJHSM7M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Up to Medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an excellent in-depth resource for your Family Medicine Shelf Exam. It’s more commonly used for Step 2 CK prep, and focuses on internal medicine, family medicine, neurology, ambulatory medicine, and surgery. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a clerkship scheduling tip, we recommend taking Family Medicine later in the year – especially after Medicine. This way, you will have already seen and studied for the range that Family Medicine can test you on, such as Pediatrics and Ob/Gyn.</span>
<h4><b>Neurology</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Neurology Shelf Exam tests your knowledge of diseases of the nervous system. The content covered on the Neurology Shelf Exam is narrow; it often tests topics such as nerve injuries, head trauma, central nervous system infections, neuromuscular disorders, and degenerative neurologic disorders, among others. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Files-Neurology-Third-Eugene/dp/0071848002/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2K9KT1RS9A61U&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=case+files+neurology&amp;qid=1595563546&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=case+files+neu%2Cstripbooks%2C153&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case Files Neurology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neurology-PreTest-Ninth-David-Anschel/dp/125958691X/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pretest+neurology&amp;qid=1595563697&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PreTest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a popular combination; these two resources work well together. Case Files provides its on-brand 60 clinical case scenarios that illustrate essential concepts for the Neurology clerkship and shelf exam. Each clinical case includes review questions and an extended discussion. PreTest provides 500 Neurology-focused USMLE-style questions and answers, with detailed explanations for right and wrong answers. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blueprints-Neurology-Frank-Drislane-M-D/dp/1496387392/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=blueprint+neurology&amp;qid=1595564223&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blueprints Neurology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a popular resource. It is well-organized and provides a helpful framework for understanding neurology. It’s comprehensive and can be used as a standalone resource. It teaches students through clinical vignettes and by working through a diagnosis; it provides 100 USMLE/shelf exam style questions with complete answer explanations.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the Neurology section of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Step-Up-Medicine-Dr-Steven-Agabegi/dp/1975103610/ref=pd_bxgy_img_3/143-9336013-5986046?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1975103610&amp;pd_rd_r=14675255-8b4c-481d-8a2a-f7770ef0992d&amp;pd_rd_w=nqLWQ&amp;pd_rd_wg=4qtwH&amp;pf_rd_p=ce6c479b-ef53-49a6-845b-bbbf35c28dd3&amp;pf_rd_r=Z6Z7RF3BR04J4XJHSM7M&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=Z6Z7RF3BR04J4XJHSM7M">Step Up to Medicine</a> is a great resource to consult, especially if you already purchased it for your Medicine or Family Medicine Shelf Exam!</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Ob/Gyn</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ob/Gyn Shelf Exam tests you on conditions and diseases that affect the female reproductive system across all ages (from childhood to puberty to old age). Questions will cover content such as </span><b>pregnancy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: prenatal management, physiologic changes of pregnancy, and disorders of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia, placenta previa, placental abruption, gestational diabetes); </span><b>routine health maintenance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: annuals, pap smears and breast exams, STIs; and </span><b>breast, ovarian, vaginal, uterine and cervical conditions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Files-Obstetrics-Gynecology-Fifth/dp/007184872X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=case+files+obgyn&amp;qid=1595612706&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case Files Ob/Gyn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an excellent foundational resource for your rotation. It’s a quick read and covers all the high-yield material. We recommend you read it at the start of your rotation because it’s comprehensive and will set you up for answering pimping questions in the wards, as well as what to expect on the Ob/Gyn Shelf Exam.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blueprints-Obstetrics-Gynecology-Tamara-Callahan/dp/1975134877/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=blueprints+obgyn&amp;qid=1595618153&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blueprints Ob/Gyn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a great resource, however, we recommend using it with caution because it’s rather lengthy and many students have trouble getting through all of it. It’s better to use a shorter resource like Case Files Ob/Gyn and ensure that you get a comprehensive overview of the whole subject area. That being said, Blueprints Ob/Gyn provides is an excellent resource for in-depth learning – and if you can get through it with time to spare, you’ll be set for success on your Ob/Gyn Shelf Exam.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UWorld isn’t ideal for practice questions here because it doesn’t provide many Ob/Gyn questions. </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Obstetrics-Gynecology-PreTest-Self-Assessment-Review/dp/1259585557/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pretest+obgyn&amp;qid=1595612043&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PreTest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great resource for Ob/Gyn questions; it includes 500 USMLE-style questions and answers, with detailed explanations. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We also recommend using the <a href="https://www.apgo.org/uwise-v-3-2/">uWISE (ACOG/APGO) question bank</a> as an additional question-based resource for Ob/Gyn. Some medical schools pay for their students to have access to this bank, so double-check this with a school administrator.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Pediatrics</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pediatrics Shelf Exam tests you on infant, child, and adolescent development. You should expect to see questions on normal infant/child development, developmental milestones, vaccine schedules, puberty, and diseases and conditions unique to the infant, child, and adolescent populations – for example: asthma, congenital infections and heart defects, meningitis, abnormal puberty.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Files-Pediatrics-Fifth-Eugene/dp/007183995X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=case+files+Pediatrics&amp;qid=1595620145&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case Files Pediatrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blueprints-Pediatrics-Bradley-Marino-M-D/dp/1496396464/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Blueprints+Pediatrics&amp;qid=1595620119&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blueprints Pediatrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a popular combination. </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pediatrics-Board-Review-Lloyd-Brown/dp/1496309758/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=brs+pediatrics&amp;qid=1595620274&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BRS Pediatrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a great resource and we find it to be extremely comprehensive. If you’re able to get two texts, then we recommend Case Files Pediatrics as the foundational quick-read text, with your choice of Blueprints Pediatrics or BRS Pediatrics. (Blueprints Pediatrics is more popular, but as mentioned, BRS Pediatrics is a great, thorough resource if you have more time).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pediatrics-PreTest-Self-Assessment-Review-Fifteenth/dp/1260440338/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pediatrics+pretest&amp;qid=1595620581&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">Pediatrics PreTest</a> is a great resource for questions, especially if you’ve exhausted UWorld for Pediatrics. It has 500 USMLE/shelf exam-style questions with thorough and clear explanations for correct and incorrect answer choices.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Psychiatry</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Psychiatry Shelf Exam tests your knowledge of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of mental and neurologic disorders. You should expect to see questions on personality disorders, mood disorders (depression, mania), anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, substance-related mental disorders, schizophrenia and other psychoses. The Psychiatry Shelf Exam also focuses on the adverse effects of its medications – you should know the common side effects of every important/commonly prescribed psychiatric drug.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Aid-Psychiatry-Clerkship-Fifth/dp/1260143392/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3KZ8T7L4JV0BT&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=first+aid+for+the+psychiatry+clerkship&amp;qid=1595623764&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=first+aid+for+the+%2Cstripbooks%2C143&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Aid for the Psychiatry Clerkship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a must-read for the Psychiatry Shelf Exam and Clerkship. It’s short, easy to read, and comprehensive (it covers everything you’d need to know).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Files-Psychiatry-Fifth-LANGE/dp/0071835326/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=case+files+psychiatry&amp;qid=1595625037&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case Files Psychiatry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great additional resource that will help you prep effectively for the Psychiatry Shelf Exam, as it does a great job of distinguishing between various disorders (especially adjustment disorders like PTSD vs. acute stress disorder) that have significant overlap and can be difficult to distinguish.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use UWorld along with First Aid and Case Files, you’ll be set for success on the Psychiatry Shelf Exam.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Surgery</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Surgery Shelf Exam is one of the more difficult shelf exams. Importantly, the Surgery Shelf is more medicine heavy – details about actual surgeries and surgical techniques are not on the exam. The focus of the Surgery Shelf Exam is more on diagnosis, the decision-making that goes into offering surgery, post-op management, and the risks/complications of various surgeries. Trauma management is heavily tested. You should know the ABCs and be able to apply them properly.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Pestanas-Surgery-Notes-Vignettes/dp/1506254349/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pestana+surgery+review&amp;qid=1595627044&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Pestana’s Surgery Notes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a must-have – it’s extremely high-yield and quick to read (only about 140 pages). It has excellent content and 180 practice questions. It is hands down one of the best texts available to help prep for your Surgery Shelf.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should read </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Files%C2%AE-Surgery-Fifth-Eugene/dp/1259585220/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=case+files+surgery&amp;qid=1595632576&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case Files Surgery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early on in your surgery rotation so that you can get the fundamentals down, understand what’s expected of you, and answer pimping questions on the wards more quickly and confidently. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading Case Files, read the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Surgery-Casebook-National-Medical-Independent-ebook/dp/B00YNT0O3C/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2MBW1U27NVMC2&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=nms+surgery+casebook&amp;qid=1595632609&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=nms+surger%2Cstripbooks%2C152&amp;sr=1-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NMS Surgery Casebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – it’s comprehensive, well-organized and has great diagrams. Particularly with your surgery rotation, it’s helpful to do some foundational reading before going into practice questions.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Surgery-PreTest-Self-Assessment-Review-Fourteenth/dp/1260143619/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pretest+surgery&amp;qid=1595633529&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretest Surgery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the go-to resource if you need more practice questions along with or after completing UWorld.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Surgery-Case-Based-Clinical-Review/dp/3030053865/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=divirgilio+surgery&amp;qid=1595633804&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deVirgilio Surgery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a decent resource, however it’s lengthy (700+ pages) and pretty dense. It can be a lot to get through in an 8-week rotation. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We highly recommend using Pestana, Case Files, NMS Casebook and Pretest/UWorld.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, there are four NBME Surgery tests available. You should work your schedule so that you can take at least two of them before you sit down to take the Surgery Shelf.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Be Diligent during Clerkship Year, but also Be Flexible</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how well you plan out your schedule, there are some things that are just beyond your control. You might need to take care of personal obligations or decide to take the evening off to exercise self-care after a particularly overwhelming day. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be days where it won’t be possible to meet the daily goals you’ve set out for yourself. When that happens, re-tweak and re-calibrate! Try to make up the missed work over the next two days or so. You might even have larger study disruptions, but stay firm and put in the time to re-work your study schedule. Don’t fall into a pattern of deviating from your schedule. Instead, build a habit of sticking to your schedule and be flexible in re-working it however necessary to meet your study goals for each rotation.</span>

		<title><![CDATA[Brosencephalon for Step 1 Review]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>Is Brosencephalon a good resource for USMLE Step 1 review?</h1>
If you've begun the process of reviewing for <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-tutoring-step-1/">USMLE Step 1</a>, then you might have encountered a resource called Brosencephalon. This is one of a few popular resources that many medical students use for reviewing for Step 1. Is Brosencephalon worth your time? Should you give this resource a try as you <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-study-for-usmle-step-1/">prepare</a> for Step 1, or should you focus your attention elsewhere? We took a comprehensive look at this resource, so we could present you with the pros and cons of using Brosencephalon for Step 1 review.
<h2>Brosencephalon is a flashcard deck</h2>
Brosencephalon is a pre-made deck of Anki flashcards. For those who aren't already familiar with Anki, it's a flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you learn. The design of Anki takes into account decades of research on memory, in order to present cards at the optimal intervals to help you learn information as efficiently as possible. You can create your own Anki flashcards, or upload premade flashcard decks into it. In order to use Brosencephalon, you'll need Anki.

The Brosencephalon deck was created in 2014 by Amreet Sidhu, a medical student, as a resource to study for USMLE Step 1, based off of First Aid and Pathoma. He decided to make the deck publicly available, to help other medical students in their studying. Since then, the community of medical students has continued to improve the flashcards – correcting errors, discarding useless or duplicate flashcards, and creating new cards for concepts that weren't originally included. At this point, Brosencephalon is a well-honed flashcard deck that reviews the high-yield topics for USMLE Step 1. The latest version is available free of charge <a href="https://www.brosencephalon.com/">here</a>.
<h2>This resource is great for review, rather than as a primary source for learning</h2>
Brosencephalon can be a great addition to your study toolkit. The Anki method is well-known for helping students to retain information. These are high-yield topics that are likely to show up on your exam, and Brosencephalon may help you to remember them.

At the same time, we wouldn't recommend using this as your main study resource for Step 1. The flashcards are most useful for helping you to retain information that has already been learned, rather than for learning concepts for the first time. Keep in mind that a flashcard presents a small, isolated piece of information; this is helpful for remembering facts, but will not help you to connect different concepts in order to build your overall framework of understanding and clinical reasoning skills. Also, unlike other resources (such as <a href="https://www.uworld.com/">UWorld</a>), this is not a QBank, meaning that the questions are not USMLE style. Brosencephalon is an excellent addition to other resources for Step 1 review, but is not suitable for being your primary resource.

<img class=" wp-image-3273 aligncenter" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock-flash-card-300x200.png" alt="" width="508" height="338" />
<h3>Brosencephalon organization</h3>
The Brosencephalon cards are not divided into subdecks when you download them. This is done to minimize the risk of errors occurring in the download process. Unfortunately, this means that you have a deck of over 13000 cards that aren't subdivided into sections, which can make the deck a bit unwieldy at first. Fortunately, the cards are well-tagged in a hierarchical structure (based on how topics are organized in First Aid), which  makes it easy to divide them up and use them as needed for specific subjects. You could even use these cards during your first and second year classes, to help you cement your knowledge for the long term and feel prepared for the USMLE when the time comes.
<h3>Anki requires daily use</h3>
If you haven't used Anki before, then it's important to know what you're getting into. Anki is designed to present cards in a specific, scientifically-proven way that helps you to learn and retain information. It's important that you use Anki every day, and complete that day's cards. This will include however many new cards you select per day, plus any older cards that are up for review at that time.

Because it needs to be used daily, Anki can actually be a great way to build a study habit for USMLE Step 1. If you keep up with your Anki schedule, you'll be ensuring that you dedicate some time every day to Step 1 review. At the same time, it's important to be realistic about how much time you'll have to dedicate to Anki per day. The Brosencephalon deck contains 13,000 cards, and you'll choose how many new cards you would like Anki to present per day. If you get very ambitious and choose 500 new cards per day, you'll find yourself looking at many more than that number daily, when you add in the older cards that the app will also present. If you don't end up having time to do them all on schedule, then you'll lose some of the legendary Anki efficiency. This is why you should make sure that you choose a realistic number of new cards to look at per day.
<h2>Brosencephalon can be a useful review tool for studying for USMLE Step 1</h2>
If you're considering using Brosencephalon, we recommend giving it a try as a secondary review resource. Make sure that you're prioritizing using other resources, including at least one QBank as your primary resource. However, adding Brosencephalon may make a difference for some students, especially those who feel that they would benefit from being more efficient at remembering facts.

Every student is different. As with every resource, Brosencephalon will be right for some students and not as useful for others. Creating a personalized study plan based on your strengths and weaknesses is essential for success on the USMLE Step 1. A tutor may be helpful in creating the best plan for you, to help you do well on this exam and move forward in your medical career with confidence. Medlearnity's <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">tutors</a> are highly experienced and have helped many students achieve success with Step 1 and beyond.

		<title><![CDATA[How To Study For the Internal Medicine Shelf Exam]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How can you prepare for the Internal Medicine Shelf Exam?</h1>
Although <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-tutoring-step-1/">Step 1</a> and <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">Step 2 CK</a> tend to occupy the bulk of most medical students' attention, there are also Shelf Exams to study for. These are given at the end of each rotation, and they often play a significant role in determining your grade for the clerkship.

The Shelf Exam can have a significant impact on your clerkship grade. If you know how to prepare for the exam, then you could improve not only your grade on this rotation, but also your performance on Step 2 CK. In fact, internal medicine is the most heavily emphasized specialty on Step 2 CK; given how important that exam is to your residency application, it makes sense to invest a significant amount of time in preparing for the Medicine Shelf.

At the same time, internal medicine is known for being a busy rotation, and you'll be busy on the wards and in the clinic. How can you create the right study schedule, and stick to it even when you're tired? What resources should you use, and what topics should you focus on?

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3348 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_318559694-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1708" />
<h2>What are the best resources to prepare for the Internal Medicine Shelf Exam?</h2>
Although the Medicine clerkship is generally the longest one (12 weeks at most med schools), the Medicine Shelf Exam is actually no longer than any of the other Shelf Exams – it's 110 questions in 2 hours and 45 minutes. However, because of the breadth of information that this exam can cover, it's often considered one of the more difficult Shelf Exams.

If you're wondering what to focus on as you study for the Medicine Shelf Exam, the <a href="https://www.nbme.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/SE_ContentOutlineandSampleItems.pdf">NBME content outlines</a> can be helpful. This exam focuses most heavily on conditions of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, with GI and renal coming next. Diagnosis is the most tested skill; decision trees can be useful (for example, the ones you'll find in the OnlineMedEd notes).

The sheer number of possible resources out there for studying can easily be overwhelming. Having helped many students prepare for this exam and for Step 2, we've narrowed it down to the ones that are most helpful. Here are the resources that we'd recommend you focus on to prepare for your Internal Medicine Shelf Exam.
<h3>UWorld</h3>
Remember that the Shelf Exams are essentially versions of the <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-score-280-on-usmle-step-2-ck/">USMLE</a> (actually, the questions on the Shelf Exams are "shelved," or retired, questions from past USMLE exams), and so studying <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/best-resources-for-step-2-ck-prep/">Step 2 CK</a> questions is an excellent way to prepare. <a href="https://medical.uworld.com/usmle/usmle-step-2-ck/">UWorld</a> is hands down the go-to resource for preparing for the USMLE or your Shelf Exams. You can filter the questions to get just the relevant ones. The "Medicine" category is by far the largest one, with over 1100 questions, so you'll need to be diligent to get through them all; fortunately, this is generally the longest rotation, which gives you enough time to do it. Ideally, aim to get through all of the medicine questions twice during your rotation.

We recommend using UWorld and other Qbanks as learning tool, rather than a diagnostic one. This means that you shouldn't worry about your percentage of correct answers. Rather, focus on learning as much as you can from each question and its associated explanation, whether you got the answer right or wrong.
<h3>AMBOSS</h3>
This is a very useful resource with multiple parts. It has a Qbank of USMLE-style questions, which can be filtered to just those for a particular clerkship (much like UWorld). The questions in <a href="https://www.amboss.com/us/home1?utm_expid=.CYEmr1x9Ts6bLGOezDBgdA.1&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">AMBOSS</a> have a tendency to be a little more detailed than in UWorld, which is why we recommend starting with UWorld first. Do your first pass through UWorld, then move on to AMBOSS. A week or two before your exam, go back to UWorld for your second pass through.

Besides the Qbank, AMBOSS can also be useful on the wards and in the clinic. It has a series of articles on a variety of clinical problems, which are evidence-based and updated regularly. You can use these to help you learn the most from each patient that you see, and also to help you impress your residents and attendings (which will help you to get a better clerkship grade).
<h3>OnlineMedEd</h3>
This series of videos covers high-yield topics. They're useful for review or for getting a high-level overview, and for tying various topics together. <a href="https://onlinemeded.org/">OME</a> videos can be an excellent study resource; we often recommend starting with these in the first few weeks of your clerkship, then filling in with more detailed resources once your foundation is solid.

When you're feeling tired or stressed after long hours on the wards, watching videos may feel easier than reading or doing questions. (Just make sure that you stay focused and don't fall asleep!) Some students choose to watch the OME videos on the morning of their exam or the night before, targeting topics that they know they're somewhat weaker in. There are also notes available for each video, which can serve as a very high-yield review before the exam. One of the most useful features of the notes is the decision trees; these help you to decide what to do next with a patient, given their clinical situation. They will serve you very well on the Internal Medicine Shelf Exam.
<h3>Step Up To Medicine</h3>
To supplement the Qbanks, a textbook is useful. For medicine, Step Up is a great one. Keep in mind that this book is very dense with information. If you're cramming in the last few days before the exam, don't even bother with Step Up – it will only make you feel stressed. However, if you start early and stay diligent about spending time with it daily, so that you get through the whole book before your exam, Step Up can be a great resource. (Step Up to Medicine is also very helpful for the Surgery Shelf Exam, so it's definitely worth having around.)

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3349 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1065101465-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1510" />
<h2>How can you set up a study schedule for the Internal Medicine Shelf Exam?</h2>
Third year is incredibly busy, and the medicine rotation tends to be one of the busier ones. You'll likely have relatively frequent call for much of the rotation, and you'll be spending long hours on the wards. When you get home, you'll be tired and you won't necessarily be too interested in studying. The key to making sure that studying actually happens is to schedule it in advance.

Our advice is to set a daily goal for studying (for example, a number of questions in UWorld, or a number of pages in Step Up), and do your best to meet the goal. Be flexible; if you find yourself really busy on the wards one day, it's okay not to get to all of your studying that day. Just make it up as soon as you get a chance. By having a daily goal, you know what it will take to be on track, and you can deal with the disruptions to your schedule that will inevitably arise.

We'd recommend beginning with UWorld and the OnlineMedEd videos. Once you get through these resources, then you can go to more detailed ones, like AMBOSS and Step Up. In the last week to two weeks of your rotation, go through the UWorld questions again and go through OnlineMedEd (either the notes or the videos) for the topics you're weaker in.

The wards and the clinic can be unpredictable. Although you'll be spending many long hours in these places, you never really know when you're going to end up with some extra free time. Take advantage of it when it comes. You may want to consider having Step Up in your bag, so that if you have a bit of unexpected downtime during the day, you can get some studying done.
<h2>Seek help from others for your Internal Medicine Shelf Exam</h2>
Your colleagues who have taken the Medicine Shelf before you can be a great resource. The residents you interact with on your clerkship can also be of great help. You may want to consider asking them for advice, and you could even trade books with a friend when you both move on to a new clerkship. (We do recommend using Step Up to Medicine for your Surgery Shelf Exam as well, so keep that in mind before you give it away!)

Professional tutoring can also benefit students who would like some extra help preparing, perhaps because they have failed or come close to failing past exams. It's also great for those who are considering applying to a <a href="https://mk0nrmp3oyqui6wqfm.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Charting-Outcomes-in-the-Match-2020_MD-Senior_final.pdf">highly competitive residency program</a> and would like to enhance their chances of getting in by honoring as many clerkships as possible and achieving a high <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-2-percentiles/">Step 2 CK</a> score. <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">Our tutors</a> have all scored <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-score-280-on-usmle-step-2-ck/">250+</a> on their USMLE exams, and have experience in helping med students to prepare for their NBME exams. If you're thinking about choosing this option, you can try out a <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">free session</a> to see whether it feels like the right fit for you.]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[How To Study for the Pediatrics Shelf Exam]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How can you prepare for the Pediatrics Shelf Exam?</h1>
The Pediatrics rotation can be a fun one, but it can also be challenging in its own ways. You'll be working with children, quite possibly for the first time in a medical setting (unless you've already done your family medicine rotation). You'll need to summon a playful and calming personality even when you're tired, to put your young patients (and their parents) at ease. At the same time, you'll be learning a lot of material and preparing for your Pediatrics Shelf Exam. This one is considered by many med students to be one of the more difficult Shelf Exams, mainly because of the wide variety of material that it can cover.

If you're considering going into pediatrics or a related field, then you'll definitely want to get honors on your pediatric rotation. Even if you're not considering peds, if you're thinking about any of the more competitive residencies, then you'll want to honor as many rotations as possible. At most med schools, the Shelf Exam is a significant part of the grade for each clerkship, so preparing for the Pediatrics Shelf Exam should be a priority during your rotation.

How can you ace your Pediatrics Shelf Exam? What resources should you use, and what should you focus on?

<img class=" wp-image-3305 aligncenter" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_288150239-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="456" height="304" />
<h2>What are the best resources for studying for the Pediatrics Shelf Exam?</h2>
For all of the Shelf Exams, there's such a huge variety of different resources out there that choosing which ones to focus on can be a challenge. The peds rotation is generally only six weeks long, and you'll probably have relatively frequent (something like Q4) call for a lot of it, which doesn't leave you with much spare time. You'll want to focus in on the most high-yield resources, so you can get the most out of the study time you're able to find.

The Pediatrics Shelf Exam heavily emphasizes outpatient care (65-70% of the questions, according to the <a href="https://www.nbme.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/SE_ContentOutlineandSampleItems.pdf">NBME</a>). You'll want to know the ages for developmental milestones, including the range of normal; the exam will often try to trick you by wording the description of a normal child in a way that suggests a problem, even though none exists. Have a sense for the ranges of normal vital signs for various age groups as well.
<h3>UWorld</h3>
As with other Shelf Exams, <a href="https://medical.uworld.com/usmle/usmle-step-2-ck/">UWorld</a> is one of the best resources there is for the Peds Shelf Exam. Use the UWorld <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/best-resources-for-step-2-ck-prep/">Step 2 CK</a> question bank, and select specifically the Pediatrics questions. Try to get through all of these at least once during your rotation; you might have time to do them all twice. We'd recommend doing your first pass through UWorld at the beginning of your clerkship, and then going through the Qbank again in the last week to ten days. Try to think of the questions as a learning tool, rather than a diagnostic one; don't get hung up on how many you're getting right, but just focus on learning from each one. Going through the UWorld Qbank as early as possible will also go a long way towards helping you impress your residents and attendings with your knowledge base.
<h3>OnlineMedEd</h3>
The <a href="https://onlinemeded.org/spa/pediatrics">OME</a> lecture series has become a favorite among many med students. This video series is full of high-yield information presented in a clear and easy-to-understand way. It's also more of a high-level overview without too much detail. Some students like to start with these near the beginning of the rotation, while others find it useful to watch these in the last week or so before the exam. (Of course, you can do both if you have time!)

The video format can be nice when you're feeling tired and you're having trouble feeling motivated to study; on some days, watching a video may feel easier than reading a book or doing flashcards. (Just make sure that you manage to stay awake and pay attention!) There are also notes for each lecture, which are only a page or two each; these are great for reviewing the most high-yield information in the days before the exam.
<h3>Board Review Series (BRS) Pediatrics</h3>
The BRS books are high-yield review textbooks. They're extremely dense with information, so if you decide to use BRS Peds to review for your shelf exam, make sure that you start early in your rotation. Figure out how many pages you'll need to read each day in order to get through the book at least a week before your exam (so you'll have time for reviewing). On days when you're extremely busy (for example, you have a busy night on call), then you can make up for the lost pages on a lighter day.

BRS Peds can help you to get a high score on your Pediatrics Shelf Exam, but we don't recommend using it for review; it's so dense and detailed that it will only stress you out. We'd recommend starting first with UWorld and OnlineMedEd, then progressing to BRS Peds. It will help you shine on the wards as well as on your exam. Some students prefer Case Files Pediatrics instead of BRS, because it's a little less dense. We'd say that BRS is the gold standard, but Case Files is fine as an alternative if BRS feels like too much to get through.
<h3>PreTest Pediatrics</h3>
This is a book with high-yield USMLE style questions. You may find it useful for after you finish the Pediatrics section in UWorld. This can be a great resource for keeping in your bag to study during any downtime on your rotation. We'd definitely recommend that you focus on UWorld first, but PreTest is a good supplemental option for doing practice questions when you have some extra time, or after you're finished with UWorld.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-3302 aligncenter" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1684338451-1-300x200.jpg" alt="med student preparing for pediatrics shelf exam" width="383" height="255" />
<h2>How can you create a study schedule?</h2>
Third year is probably the most challenging year of med school. Rotations offer hours that are long and often unpredictable, and pediatrics is certainly no exception. Most med students are extremely good at making a plan and sticking to it, and it can be hard to accept not being in full control of your schedule. If you make a study schedule and then find that you can't stick to it on certain days because of clinical responsibilities, it can even be easy to give up completely and just hope for the best on your exam.

At the same time, if you don't make a study schedule at all, then you could be missing out on an opportunity to stand out from the crowd by doing well on your exam. The key is to make a study schedule, but be a little bit flexible with it. You should have a daily study target, and on days when you can't get to your target, you just make it up the next day. This helps you to stay on track, while still making room for the curveballs that the rotation will certainly throw your way.

For example, figure out how many pages of BRS you would need to read each day in order to finish one week before the end of the clerkship. This becomes your target; if you miss it one day, you simply make up for it as soon as you can. Do the same with UWorld questions so that you have time to get through them all twice before the clerkship ends. When you have a rough idea of how much you need to do each day, then you know whether you're on track and you won't find yourself panicking right before the exam.
<h2>Seek support from others</h2>
Although it might seem a little overwhelming at first, the truth is that you're not the first person to go through the Pediatrics Shelf Exam. Unless it's your first rotation, you'll have colleagues who've gone through the exam before you; you can ask for their advice, and maybe even trade books with them as they rotate onto a service that you've already left. Fourth year med students and even residents are also good sources of advice, as they've taken the exam fairly recently.

For those who would like more help, a professional tutor might be a good idea. This can be particularly useful for students who have a lot of test anxiety, those who have previously failed a USMLE or Shelf exam or have come close, or those who want to truly excel in third year and on <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">Step 2 CK</a> so that they can gain that crucial edge on their residency applications. It can be extremely valuable to have someone in your corner who's been through the process of med school and residency applications and is willing to share the secrets of success with you. You can try out a <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">free one-hour session</a> if you want to see what it would be like, so that you can decide whether this is right for you.

The Pediatrics Shelf Exam is not easy, and neither is the clerkship itself. However, this can be a very rewarding and even fun clerkship as well. Whether you choose to pursue pediatrics as a career or not, you will certainly learn a lot from the experience.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How can you prepare for your Psychiatry Shelf Exam?</h1>
The psychiatry rotation tends to be a bit of a breather for many med students. After long hours on the wards in rotations like medicine and surgery, being on the psych service tends to bring somewhat more regular hours and less stress. Along with this, the Psychiatry Shelf Exam is known for being one of the less challenging of the Shelf Exams.

Still, it's worth taking the opportunity to do well on this exam. If you're considering a very competitive residency program, then honoring as many rotations as possible will certainly help. You'll be particularly interested in this exam if you're considering psychiatry for your residency, or even a primary care specialty; for example, family medicine includes treating patients with psychiatric conditions such as depression. Psych questions will also show up on <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">Step 2 CK</a>, so preparing for this Shelf Exam can only help you in <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-score-280-on-usmle-step-2-ck/">improving your Step 2 CK score</a>, which is one of the most important aspects of your residency application.

How can you study for the Psychiatry Shelf Exam? How should you create your study schedule, and what should you focus on?

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3425 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1153332985.jpg" alt="Psychiatry Shelf Exam" width="1000" height="667" />
<h2>What are the best resources to study for the Psychiatry Shelf Exam?</h2>
Although it's tempting to think of the Psychiatry exam as solely testing knowledge of mental health conditions, this would be a mistake. Making a psychiatric diagnosis often requires ruling out organic causes of the symptoms. Don't immediately assume that all of the patients on the Psych Shelf have psychiatric conditions.

Focus on mood disorders, personality disorders, psychoses, and anxiety disorders. You'll want to know the criteria for the various diagnoses and how to differentiate between them. Another frequently tested topic is major psychiatric medications and their primary side effects. Don't worry too much about uncommon side effects, but you should definitely know the common side effects for the most-used drugs.

The exam tends to use very long question stems. These can easily take up a lot of your exam time, when you had the information that you needed in the first couple of lines. Pay close attention to what you read at the beginning of the clinical vignette. Skim the rest of the question stem to find what you need to answer it, but don't get hung up on reading all of the details closely, as this will just cost you precious time.

Important note: Make sure that your study materials use the DSM-5, which was released in 2013. This would potentially be an issue if you inherit some books from a family member or friend, or if you purchase used books.
<h3>UWorld</h3>
Many med students use <a href="https://medical.uworld.com/usmle/usmle-step-2-ck/">UWorld</a>'s extensive question bank to prepare for their USMLE Steps, and it's very useful for the Shelf Exams too. Aim to get through all of the psych questions in UWorld at least once during your clerkship. If you get through them twice, then you'll be well-prepared for the Psychiatry Shelf Exam, as well as for psych questions on Step 2 CK.

UWorld is best used as a study aid, rather than a diagnostic one. In other words, don't focus on the percentage of correct answers that you achieve. Instead, use the questions as a learning tool. You'll find that you learn a lot of high-yield information even when you get a question wrong.
<h3>OnlineMedEd</h3>
The <a href="https://onlinemeded.org/spa/psychiatry">OnlineMedEd</a> videos are useful throughout the third year clerkships. The videos do an excellent job of summarizing high-yield information in an easy-to-understand format. We recommend OME for all of the Shelf Exams, and psych is no exception; this can be a great way of getting a handle on subjects like psychiatric medications that can tend to trip up some students.

There are also notes available for each video, which are concise (generally just a page or two per video) and extremely high-yield. Reading through the notes can be a great way of reviewing before the exam.
<h3>First Aid</h3>
First Aid for the Psychiatry Clerkship is a great book, summarizing everything you need to know for the Psychiatry Shelf Exam and for your clinical experiences on this rotation. You most likely used First Aid for USMLE Step 1, so you're familiar with the format of the series (high-yield information, mostly presented in bulleted lists). This one is shorter at only about 200 pages, and can be very helpful in helping you shine in the eyes of your residents and attendings as well as acing your exam. We'd recommend keeping this in your bag to take advantage of any downtime you may encounter, and also to give you a chance to read up on your patients.
<h2>How can you create a study schedule?</h2>
Third year can be very intense, and it's nice to have a bit of a breather on the psych rotation, as it tends to be less time-intensive than many other clerkships. We do recommend that you give yourself a little bit of time off during this clerkship, in order to keep yourself from burning out. At the same time, you should definitely take this clerkship seriously, and ensure that you study the material in order to do well on your Shelf Exam and Step 2.

We recommend starting with the UWorld questions during the first week of the rotation. This will help you not only with the exam, but also will prepare you well to take good care of your patients and impress your residents and attendings throughout your clerkship. With only 310 questions, you should be able to get through these fairly quickly. You can then move on to more detailed resources, like First Aid and OME. Keeping First Aid in your bag can be a great way to take advantage of any downtime that you end up with during your rotation. Just before the exam, go back through UWorld to ensure that you have mastered the content.
<h2>Accept help from others as you prepare for your third year exams</h2>
Your colleagues who have already finished their psych rotations can be great sources of information about the exam. They may even be willing to share resources with you; for example, some med students trade books with their friends when they both move to a new clerkship. Residents are also a great source of tips for the exam, because they've taken their Shelf Exams fairly recently.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3428 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_621983594.jpg" alt="Psychiatry Shelf Exam" width="1000" height="638" />

Preparing for your <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/nbme-shelf-exams/">Shelf Exams</a> throughout third year is important not only to allow you to get honors on as many rotations as possible, but also to ensure that you're well-prepared for Step 2 CK. Make sure that you take every Shelf Exam seriously. If you'd like some guidance as you prepare for your Shelf Exams and Step 2, you might want to consider reaching out to a professional tutor with experience in helping students prepare for these exams. You'll get a personalized study plan along with test-taking strategies, which will help to boost your confidence as you go into the exam. Many students can benefit from tutoring, including those who find themselves falling behind, those who have a lot of test anxiety, and those who want to gain that crucial edge so they can truly excel.

To find out what tutoring is like, you can book a <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">free one-hour session</a> here at Medlearnity. <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">Our tutors</a> have all scored 250+ on their USMLE exams, and have extensive experience in helping students prepare for Step 2. Your free session will let you decide for yourself whether tutoring is right for you.

The psychiatry clerkship can be a challenging one, and can sometimes feel emotionally draining to many med students. At the same time, it can be a very interesting and rewarding experience.]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[How to Study for the MCAT]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1><b>How To Prepare for the MCAT So You Can Ace It</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All journeys begin with a single step, and for the medical profession, that first step is the Medical College Admission Test, or MCAT. The test itself is no mere formality, since how well you do on the MCAT is a strong indicator of your success in medical school. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’ll give you some of the most useful tips for how to study for the MCAT, and help kickstart your medical career.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3266" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1723595515-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="278" />
<h2><b>How to study for the MCAT</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The MCAT is a computer-based, 7.5 hour multiple-choice exam that tests your knowledge in the physical and biological sciences, as well as your verbal reasoning skills and writing ability. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your MCAT score is one of the most important factors in your medical school application. Medical school admissions committees will primarily focus on your MCAT score, your performance in pre-medical coursework in college, and your undergraduate GPA to gauge how well you’ll adapt to the rigors of medical school and clinical training. Soft factors such as extracurricular and volunteer activities are also taken into account. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The MCAT is the one part of the application that’s standard across all applicants, so it has a particular importance in making admissions decisions. Because of this strong influence, it pays to be well-prepared for this exam. Here are a few things to keep in mind when studying for the MCAT.</span>
<h3><b>Know what to expect.</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The saying “knowing is half the battle” rings especially true when it comes to taking exams. Knowing exactly what content the MCAT covers is critical to your preparation plans, and thus to your ultimate success on the exam. Becoming familiar with the exam will help you to plan how to study for the MCAT.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The MCAT covers General and Organic Chemistry, General Biology, Biochemistry, Sociology, Psychology, and Physics. It also assesses your critical analysis and reasoning skills.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The subjects covered by the MCAT fall into four main sections:</span>

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems</em></span></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chem/Phys section of the MCAT is 95 minutes long and consists of 59 total questions; 44 of these are passage-related questions, and 15 are standalone questions. Because the majority of questions are passage-related, it is important for a test-taker to understand that the right answers to these questions require information from the passage as well as knowledge in the basic and medical sciences. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The questions in this section will assess your ability to understand the chemical and physical principles that form the foundation of the processes and functions of the human body. The primary undergraduate coursework that will be critical to your success in this section includes General Chemistry I &amp; II, Physics I, Organic Chemistry I, and Biochemistry I. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You will have access to a periodic table while answering questions in this section of the MCAT.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><b>Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems</b></em></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bio/Biochem section of the MCAT consists of 59 total questions and is 95 minutes long. 44 of the 59 questions are passage-related questions, and 15 are standalone questions. As with the Chem/Phys section, the right answers to passage-related questions require information from the passage as well as outside content knowledge. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This section tests you on the life processes that make living organisms unique, such as reproduction, homeostasis, and acquiring materials and energy. The primary undergraduate coursework most useful to success in this section is primarily Biology I &amp; II, Biochemistry I, General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry. Cellular and Molecular Biology, Anatomy &amp; Physiology, and a basic knowledge of statistics will also be helpful.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You will have access to a periodic table while answering questions in this section as well.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><b>Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior</b></em></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Psych/Soc section of the MCAT also consists of 59 questions, which you get 95 minutes to complete. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This section tests your understanding of the ways in which psychological, biological, social and socio-cultural factors influence how different individuals interact with and perceive themselves, as well as the environment and world around them. This section is the newest material on the MCAT primarily because of its increased importance in medical education; there is an increased awareness that social stratification and access to resources have a significant impact on a medical patient’s well-being, and future physicians need to recognize the various dimensions of social issues in medicine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most useful undergraduate coursework for success in this section is introductory psychology and sociology. General Biology will also be useful, especially concepts that relate to mental processes and behavior. Furthermore, it will be important for you to apply your knowledge in research methods and statistics to the social and behavioral sciences.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 59 total questions in the Psych/Soc section, 44 are passage-related questions, and 15 are standalone questions. As with previous sections, the right answers to passage-related questions require information from the passage as well as outside content knowledge.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><b>Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills</b></em></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The critical analysis and reasoning skills, or “CARS,” portion of the exam is 90 minutes long and  consists of 53 questions. This section evaluates your reading comprehension, analysis and reasoning skills by testing your ability to critically analyze information provided in the passages. Particularly, it assesses your ability to analyze arguments, identify assumptions and inferences, connect the various ideas and theories that appear throughout the passage, and understand the authors’ point of view.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike in the other sections, the CARS section doesn’t require any specific prior content knowledge. All of the information needed to answer each question can be found in the relevant passage. Each passage is about 500-600 words, and could be related to any discipline from the social sciences and humanities. This section is not about content, but about reasoning ability.</span>
<h3><img class=" wp-image-3265 aligncenter" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1535364272-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="261" /></h3>
<h3>Identify your weaknesses.</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you know the material that the MCAT is going to cover, you should dedicate time to evaluating your strengths and weaknesses across the various MCAT sections. To make an efficient and focused study plan, it’s critical that you honestly and accurately identify your weaknesses. This will allow you to focus your studying on the areas where you most need to improve. Subjects and topics that you are not entirely comfortable with need to be drilled extensively and early on, while those that you already know well won’t require as much time.</span>
<h3><b>Create a study plan that connects concepts.</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of the coverage of the MCAT is interconnected. Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Organic Chemistry and Physics are major subject areas of the MCAT. Knowing how these subjects relate to each other will help you answer the test questions more easily. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a study plan that helps you to see the relationships between the subjects that you cover. Rather than studying each subject in isolation, spend some time looking at the connections between them. This will also improve the flow of your review and allow you to understand concepts faster.</span>
<h3><b>Repetition, repetition, repetition.</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Memorization requires repetition. Flashcards may seem like a basic concept, but they're extremely useful. If you want a modern take on the flashcard concept, you may want to try </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s a flashcard app that can be installed on a PC, tablets, or mobile, and uses spaced repetition to enhance learning so that you can memorize more efficiently. Once you have the Anki app, you can download flashcard decks for anything that you want to learn; there are a number of decks out there for MCAT review. (Many medical students also rely on Anki, to help them achieve success during their medical school coursework and on their <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle/">board exams</a>.)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer making physical flashcards, then that’s great too – just make sure that you spend enough time using them to get the benefits.</span>
<h3><b>Don’t be afraid to ask for help.</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With any challenge that you may be facing, there’s a very good chance that someone somewhere has already gone through it before you. This is very much true with the MCAT. You're not the first person to face this hurdle. Don’t be afraid to ask people who have already aced the exam for tips about preparing for it. Most pre-med and medical students enjoy helping others and are happy to share.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sites like </span><a href="https://www.medlearnity.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medlearnity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer online tutoring with experts in the medical field that have invaluable knowledge for taking the MCAT. One way to gain a significant edge on the MCAT is to take advantage of this resource.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing well on the MCAT is definitely all about preparation. Knowing what to study and how to study will improve the efficiency of your time, and the effectiveness of your learning and knowledge retention. Working with a tutor who understands the exam, provides you with invaluable study tips, and keeps you on a focused study schedule will put you on the right path to success. If you're curious about what it's like to work with a tutor, you can try out a <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">free trial session</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We wish you the best on this tough but rewarding journey of medicine!</span>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[How to Study for the Neurology Shelf Exam]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How to prepare for your Neurology Shelf Exam</h1>
The Neurology clerkship can be a challenging one for many med students. Depending on the med school, this rotation may be taken during third year or during fourth year, but it's required at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4239836/">most</a> schools. Neurology is a subject that can be intimidating to some students, with its extensive exam and predilection for complex terminology. The Neurology Shelf Exam has a reputation for being a challenging one for this reason.

Because a clerkship's Shelf Exam is generally a large component of your final grade, getting honors on the neurology rotation will often depend on doing well on this exam. Whether you're considering neurology or a related field, or you're considering a highly competitive residency and want to have the best possible academic record, you'll want to do well on the Neurology Shelf Exam. Studying for this exam will also help you to do well on Step 2 CK, which is a crucial exam.
<h2>What resources should you use to study for the Neurology Shelf Exam?</h2>
The Neurology question stems tend to be long (like the <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-study-for-the-psychiatry-shelf-exam/">Psychiatry</a> stems), so one of the most important skills is being able to sort through what's important and what's not. The key information will often be found in the first sentence of the stem. When you read the first sentence, immediately try to form a differential. Skim the rest of the question, looking for the information that you need to narrow down your differential and arrive at the correct diagnosis. There will often be a lot of extraneous information, but don't let it distract you; focus in on what you really need to know to diagnose the patient.

Lesion localization is very high-yield for this exam. Focus on cerebrovascular anatomy, to allow you to localize a stroke. It's also very useful to know your spinal cord anatomy, cranial nerves (along with their functions), dermatomes, and major nerve distributions in the limbs. These are essentially basic anatomy questions, but they will allow you to succeed on quite a few of the Neurology Shelf questions.

Another high-yield topic is pharmaceuticals. There are several diagnoses in neurology that have a wide array of different medications available to treat them (for example, epilepsy and migraine). Knowing the differences between the various drugs, and what their side effects are, is a key to answering many of the questions on the exam.
<h3>UWorld</h3>
As with the other Shelf Exams, one of the best resources on the Neurology Shelf Exam is <a href="https://medical.uworld.com/usmle/usmle-step-2-ck/">UWorld for Step 2 CK</a>. (You can filter to see just the neurology questions by clicking "Systems" and then "Nervous System.") It's best to consider UWorld questions to be a learning experience, rather than a diagnostic tool. In other words, don't worry about how many questions you get right during your UWorld study sessions; just focus on learning as much as you can from each question, whether you get it right or wrong. (Even when you get a question right, there may be more details that you can learn!)

The great thing about using UWorld to study for your Shelf Exams is that you'll be extremely well-prepared when it comes time to take Step 2 CK, since you'll have gone through the whole question bank twice during third year.
<h3>AMBOSS</h3>
This is another online question bank that has recently become available to US medical students. After you finish getting through the neurology questions on UWorld, we recommend supplementing that with AMBOSS. Compared with UWorld, the questions on AMBOSS tend to be more challenging, and the explanations, while useful, are shorter. This is why we recommend starting with UWorld and then adding extra details with AMBOSS.
<h3>PreTest Neurology</h3>
This is a book with 500 practice questions. As with UWorld, use the practice questions as a learning experience. This book can be great to have in your bag to use during any downtime during your rotation. It does only come in print, rather than an electronic version; some students prefer physical books, while others don't like to carry them around.
<h3>First Aid, Blueprints, or Case Files</h3>
Consider supplementing your question-based learning with one of these textbooks. All of them are good, so choose the one that best fits your learning style. Case Files presents information in the context of a clinical vignette, First Aid uses a bulletpoint style, and Blueprints is more of a narrative text with a little more detail. It's likely that you've used books from at least one of these series before, so choose the one that you feel the most comfortable with. It's not necessary to use more than one of them.
<h2>Topics</h2>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There are a few specific topics that are high-yield for this exam. Try to focus your studying on these.
<h3>Lesion localization</h3>
&nbsp;
<h3>Medications (and their side effects)</h3>
For example, for a patient who has migraine and also hypertension, a beta blocker would be the preferred choice for prophylaxis. If the migraine patient instead has concomitant depression, amitryptiline may be a better choice.
<h2>Use guidance as needed</h2>
Of course, you're not the first medical student to take the Shelf Exams. There's help available. If you're feeling a little lost or overwhelmed, or simply would like some guidance in how to best use your time and study for the Neurology Shelf Exam, then you might benefit from a professional tutor.

Here at Medlearnity, <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">our tutors</a> have scored extremely well on Step 2 CK as well as their Shelf Exams, and they enjoy helping medical students achieve the same feat. Whether you're looking to score well on your Neurology Shelf, on Step 2 CK, or even to improve your overall residency application (including the potentially daunting <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-write-a-great-personal-statement-for-residency/">personal statement</a>),]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[How to Study for the Family Medicine Shelf Exam]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How can you prepare for the Family Medicine Shelf Exam?</h1>
Many students enter into the family medicine rotation hoping that it will be a bit of a break from the intensity of rotations like surgery and internal medicine. It's true that this rotation is generally clinic-heavy, with little to no inpatient care or call. At the same time, it's important not to get complacent on this rotation. A fully-booked clinic day can certainly be stressful, and the variety of different clinical situations that you may encounter on family medicine is huge.

The Family Medicine Shelf Exam presents a unique challenge. The breadth of material that can potentially be covered on this exam is huge. You could have a question about a senior with dementia, followed by a question about a pregnant woman with depression, followed by a question about the vaccination schedule for infants. How can you possibly study for an exam that covers such a diverse range of topics?

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3481 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_1695205249-1.jpg" alt="family medicine shelf exams" width="1000" height="668" />

&nbsp;

While it is a challenge, the breadth of topics on this exam can also be a great opportunity. Studying for the Family Medicine Shelf will be very helpful on <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">Step 2 CK</a>, as you'll be reviewing and connecting content that you've learned in various specialties. Whether you want to honor your family med rotation or simply ensure that you're <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-score-280-on-usmle-step-2-ck/">prepared</a> for Step 2 CK, the right study plan can help you to do well on the Family Medicine Shelf.
<h2>What are the best resources to prepare for the Family Medicine Shelf Exam?</h2>
At first, family medicine may seem like an impossibly broad knowledge base. However, keep in mind that you will not be expected to be an expert in every area. The Family Med Shelf will test your ability to differentiate between the problems that a family physician would manage on their own in a clinic setting (such as managing meds for a patient with diabetes and hypertension), and those who would need referral to a specialist. (Basically, you need to be able to manage the horses, and refer the zebras to a specialist.) It will also expect you to be able to recognize an unstable patient who should be transferred to an inpatient setting.

A family physician also focuses on screening and disease prevention. It's likely that you'll be asked about vaccine schedules, as well as the current guidelines for screening exams such as colonoscopies and mammograms. You should also have a sense of what lifestyle modifications would be helpful for preventing complications, including guidelines for exercise and nutrition, as well as pharmacologic interventions that are useful for disease prevention.
<h3>OnlineMedEd</h3>
This is a great site with a series of videos on high-yield topics. To make things a little easier, the videos that are relevant to family medicine are grouped together <a href="https://onlinemeded.org/family-medicine-shelf/">here</a>. Along with the videos, there are also notes for each one; these are particularly useful for quick review before the exam.
<h3>Case Files</h3>
We recommend carrying a book in your bag to study whenever you find downtime in the clinic, and Case Files Family Medicine is a great one. You can use it in the clinic to learn more about your patients' clinical problems and review information connected to them. This helps you to connect content to experiences, which is very helpful for learning. You'll also want to read cases related to clinical problems you haven't encountered, because a few weeks of clinic may not expose you to all of the clinical situations you'll need to know about.
<h3>UWorld</h3>
Although UWorld is helpful for all of the Shelf Exams, it can be a little bit trickier to use for the Family Med Shelf than for some of the others. This is because UWorld doesn't make it easy to filter for the questions relevant to family medicine. As a result, this is the one Shelf for which UWorld may be more of a challenge to use. One option is to use the pediatrics, ob/gyn, and internal medicine topics, but this could easily be overwhelming to try to get through in the short time that you have. Although UWorld is still helpful, there are two other sources of questions that may be more useful for the Family Med Shelf: PreTest and the AAFP.
<h3>PreTest Family Medicine</h3>
PreTest is a print book rather than an online resource. This allows you to carry it in your bag to review when you find downtime in the clinic. It contains 500 high-yield questions on ambulatory medicine, so it's a good question bank for the Family Medicine Shelf Exam. We would definitely recommend getting through all of these at least once before your exam.
<h3>AAFP website question bank</h3>
The American Academy of Family Physicians, or AAFP, offers a useful <a href="https://www.aafp.org/cme/all/board-review-questions.html">Qbank</a> on its site. Though designed for the family medicine boards, it's also high-yield for the Family Medicine Shelf Exam. If you sign up for a student membership to AAFP (which is free), you have access to this Qbank. This is another great option for getting questions that are similar to what you'll see on your Family Med Shelf. We'd actually recommend starting with these questions, and going to UWorld later if you have extra time.
<h3>Step Up to Medicine</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3479 size-large" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_1759555454-1024x640.jpg" alt="Family medicine Shelf exams" width="1024" height="640" />

This book is extremely high-yield for the Internal Medicine Shelf. It covers all of general internal medicine, and tends to emphasize inpatient care. However, the section on ambulatory care patients is very relevant to the Family Medicine Shelf. You'll definitely want this book for both your Internal Medicine and Surgery Shelves, so it's worth the investment. If you get through the ambulatory care section in Step Up during your family med rotation, you should be well-prepared for the exam.
<h2>How can you create a study schedule for the Family Medicine Shelf Exam?</h2>
The family med rotation is clinic-heavy; your clinical experiences will take place mostly or entirely in the outpatient setting, generally leaving you with nights and weekends free. This may make it seem like this rotation will be a bit of a break, although it's important not to underestimate this rotation. You will definitely need to be on your game to do well on family medicine.

Still, although some clinic days are very busy, there also tend to be some slower days in the clinic with more downtime between patients. It's a great idea to have at least one book in your bag, so that you can study whenever you find yourself with extra time. This will also allow you to read up on the patients that you see, to help you shine in the eyes of your residents and attendings.

Because your schedule is likely to be somewhat more predictable on this rotation, you may find that it's easier to stick to a study schedule. You'll want to create a study target; take all of the content you want to get through before your exam, and divide it up so that you know how much you need to complete each day. There may be some days when you can't meet your target, because your clinical responsibilities end up being more than you imagined. That's okay; just make up the study time on a different day. You could plan on using a little extra time on the weekends for studying as well. (We also do recommend giving yourself some break time each weekend. Rest is important to avoid burnout!)
<h2>Seek help from others</h2>
As with all of the exams along the medical journey, from the <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/mcat/">MCAT</a> through your specialty boards, you aren't the first one to go through this. Ask people who have recently completed the exam to give you their study tips. Your friends in MS3, as well as MS4s and residents that you meet on your rotation, can be great sources of information.

For those who want some extra help studying for their Shelf Exams or Step 2 CK, you may want to consider hiring a professional tutor. You'll want to choose someone who has experience in helping students to prepare for their exams, so that you know they'll be able to give you the best advice. <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">Medlearnity tutors</a> are physicians who performed very highly on their USMLE exams, and they have <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-services/">experience</a> in helping others to perform their best as well. We're confident that once you experience our services, you'll see the very high value that we provide. That's why we offer a one-hour free trial, with no obligation. You can get started <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">here</a>.

We hope that you find your family medicine rotation enjoyable and rewarding.]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[How to Study for the OBGYN Shelf Exam]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How can you prepare for the OBGYN Shelf Exam?</h1>
Obstetrics and gynecology, commonly called OBGYN (sometimes written OB/GYN or OB-GYN), can be an enjoyable rotation. Pregnancy is a unique time in a woman's life, and the birth of a child is often one of life's happiest moments. You'll have the honor of participating in many births and sharing in a bit of that joy. At the same time, when problems occur in a pregnancy or during a birth, the results can be absolutely devastating. You'll be a part of the team caring for women and their families as they go through such a crisis.

While you're participating in clinical activities, you'll also be preparing for the OBGYN Shelf Exam. Since a significant part of your clerkship grade is generally determined by your grade on this exam, it's important to prepare for it if you'd like to honor the rotation. Whether you're considering going into OBGYN and need to honor this specific rotation, or you'd like to honor as many rotations as possible, make sure that you spend time studying for this exam. Since the Shelf Exams are very similar to <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">Step 2 CK</a>, spending time getting ready for them will also ensure that you're well-prepared to achieve a high score on that crucial exam, which in turn will set you up for landing a spot in the residency of your choice.

How can you prepare for the OBGYN Shelf Exam? What study resources are best, and how can you set up your study plan?

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3358 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1374682136.jpg" alt="OBGYN" width="1000" height="527" />
<h2>What are the best resources for studying for the OBGYN Shelf Exam?</h2>
Finding time to study for the OBGYN Shelf Exam can be a challenge. You'll likely have call fairly frequently (something like Q4) for most of the rotation, and OB call is notoriously unpredictable; you never know whether it's going to be a busy night with several deliveries, or a completely quiet night. In order to carve out time to study, you'll want to have some study resources in your bag, so you can take advantage of whatever quiet time you manage to find.

Of course, the exam covers both obstetrics and gynecology, but which one is emphasized more heavily? According to the <a href="https://www.nbme.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/SE_ContentOutlineandSampleItems.pdf">NBME</a>, the two fields are about equally represented on the OBGYN Shelf. You'll want to know the milestones of a normal pregnancy; the exam will sometimes try to trick you by presenting a normal pregnancy in a way that makes it seem like it might be abnormal. Gynecological cancers (including breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers) are also a high-yield topic. Sexual health, including birth control methods and sexually transmitted diseases, is another area to focus on.
<h3>UWorld</h3>
We generally recommend using UWorld for the Shelf Exams, and OBGYN is no exception. You can filter the Step 2 CK questions so that you see only those relevant to obstetrics and gynecology. If you get through all of the UWorld questions at least once before your exam, and preferably twice, then you should be well on your way to a great score. (It's a bonus that you'll be well on your way to a <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/how-to-score-280-on-usmle-step-2-ck/">great Step 2 CK score</a> as well!) It often works well to start with one pass through UWorld, move on to other resources, and then go back through UWorld again in the last week of the clerkship.

Remember to use UWorld as a learning tool, not as a diagnostic one. In other words, don't get hung up on how many red Xs versus green checks you see as you're going through the questions; focus instead on learning as much as possible from the questions and their explanations.
<h3>AMBOSS</h3>
If you spend about an hour per day studying the UWorld questions, then you'll be finished with your first pass through them in about two weeks. You'll still have four more weeks left in your clerkship, which is plenty of time to work with another Qbank. AMBOSS offers a great one that can supplement what you learn in UWorld. The questions in AMBOSS tend to be more detailed than in UWorld, which is why we recommend that you start with UWorld and then proceed to AMBOSS with the time that you have left.

Another bonus of AMBOSS is that it offers a series of evidence-based clinical articles (similar to UpToDate). These are great to use during your clinical experiences to help you shine on rounds. Learning that takes place through experience is the most durable, so learning from your patients is ideal.
<h3>Textbook: either High Yield or Case Files</h3>
Qbanks are excellent resources, but you'll want to supplement that with reading a textbook in order to be fully prepared for the exam. We recommend choosing either High Yield Obstetrics and Gynecology or Case Files Obstetrics and Gynecology. Either one is a good resource for reviewing high yield information for the OBGYN Shelf Exam. Choose whichever of these textbook series you've previously found most helpful; they're pretty equivalent, and there's no need to use both of them.

If you're planning on an OBGYN residency, then you might want to choose Blueprints Obstetrics and Gynecology as your textbook. This one is more detailed, and so you'll need to dedicate more time to studying if you want to get through it. For most students, it's probably more than you need, but for those who are planning to go into OBGYN, it may be worth it.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3341 size-large" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_528321097-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="Obgyn Shelf exams" width="1024" height="683" />
<h2>How can you create a study schedule?</h2>
OBGYN has a tendency to be one of the busier clerkships. You'll find that your OB call is particularly hard to predict; on some nights, you might be a part of several deliveries with very little downtime, while on other nights, there won't be much going on. Be prepared to take advantage of downtime whenever you find it. Keeping a book in your bag is a great way to make use of whatever time you're able to find.

It can be hard to stay committed to studying for your Shelf Exam when you're tired. Med school is all about striking that balance between resting enough and studying enough. We've found that it works best to set yourself a daily study goal. For example, determine how many UWorld questions you would need to get through each day in order to get to them all twice before the end of the rotation. This becomes your study target. Do your best to meet your target each day, but be flexible; if you have a busy day and can't find enough time to study, simply make it up later when you find yourself with more time. You can do something similar with whichever book you choose. Having a target helps you to stay on track with your studying, while being flexible with your schedule helps you to deal with the unpredictability of the wards without getting too stressed.
<h2>Seek support to help you optimize your score</h2>
Students in your class will go through their third year clerkships in different orders. This may mean that some of your colleagues have taken the OBGYN Shelf Exam before you. You might want to seek advice from them about studying for it; you can even share resources with each other (such as trading books). Students who are one year ahead of you can also be a great resource for advice on studying for the exam.

If you're struggling to prepare for your Shelf Exams during your clinical years of med school, or if you want to improve your chances of getting outstanding third year clerkship grades, then you may benefit from professional advice. Here at Medlearnity, <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">our tutors</a> all scored 250+ on Step 2 CK, and are experts at helping other students to prepare for it. By helping you to assess your strengths and weaknesses, creating a personalized study plan, and then helping you stick to it, your tutor can help you to ace your OBGYN Shelf Exam and be well on your way to a strong performance on Step 2 CK, so that you can land a spot in the residency of your choice. If you'd like to see what it's like to work with a tutor, we invite you to schedule a <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/free-trial-page/">free one-hour session</a> with no obligation.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How can you prepare for the Radiology Shelf Exam?</h1>
Radiology is an important part of all medicine. Regardless of which specialty you end up pursuing, it will benefit both you and your patients if you feel confident in interpreting their imaging studies. Despite this importance, not all medical schools even require a radiology rotation as part of the curriculum; it's often an elective. If you're considering radiology as a specialty, then you'll be particularly interested in doing well on this exam.

		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How can you prepare for your General Surgery Shelf Exam?</h1>
The general surgery clerkship is known for being one of the most challenging rotations for third year medical students. It often requires long hours on the wards and in the OR, with relatively frequent call. After weeks of this (usually 6 to 8 weeks, depending on the med school), you will then be faced with the Surgery Shelf Exam, which has a reputation as being one of the more challenging Shelf Exams. This exam is generally a significant component of honoring your surgery rotation. Those who are considering a residency in a surgical field, or those who plan to apply to competitive residency programs and therefore want to honor as many rotations as possible, will definitely want to do well on this exam.

How can you prepare for the Surgery Shelf Exam?
<h2>What resources are best for studying for the Surgery Shelf Exam?</h2>
Although this is officially a surgery exam, it's common for students to report that it felt more like the Medicine Shelf than they expected. This is because the exam doesn't just focus on what happens in the OR itself; it includes pre-op and post-op patient management, as well as deciding whether a patient needs surgical care or not. If you've already taken your medicine clerkship, that will help; if not, then studying for the Surgery Shelf will help you later on the Medicine Shelf.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3463 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_164470781.jpg" alt="Surgery Shelf exams" width="1000" height="664" />

Management of trauma is another high-yield topic. Remember that a patient must be stable (ABCs – Airway, Breathing, Circulation) before you send them for any imaging studies. Focus on the most urgent aspects of the patient's condition before you worry about making a detailed diagnosis.
<h3>UWorld</h3>
As with other Shelf Exams, <a href="https://medical.uworld.com/usmle/usmle-step-2-ck/">UWorld</a> is the go-to resource. You can use the Step 2 CK Qbank, and filter for the Surgery questions. Try to get through all of them at least once, and preferably twice, before you take your Surgery Shelf. We generally recommend doing your first pass through UWorld at the beginning of the clerkship, which will prepare you to shine in your clinical evaluations as well as starting your preparations for the exam. Then move on to other resources. In the last week or two before the exam, go back through UWorld again to solidify your knowledge.

Remember to use UWorld as a learning tool, focusing on learning the most possible from each question. Whether you got the answer right or wrong is less important than learning from the question and its explanation.
<h3>AMBOSS</h3>
<a href="https://www.amboss.com/us">This resource</a> has multiple parts integrated into one platform. There's a Qbank, with USMLE-style questions and explanations. The questions on AMBOSS tend to be a little more detailed than on UWorld, and so we recommend finishing up your first pass through UWorld first in order to establish your knowledge base, and then going to AMBOSS afterwards to fill in more details and reinforce your learning.

AMBOSS also offers a series of evidence-based articles on clinically relevant topics. This can be very useful for learning the most from each of your patients, and impressing your residents and attendings during your rotation.
<h3>Dr. Pestana's Surgery Notes</h3>
This is a great surgery textbook. It's short and concise, but full of high-yield information. It also contains a few practice questions (although you'll have plenty of those with UWorld and AMBOSS). We'd recommend getting through this book at least once during your rotation. It's a small book, so it's easy to keep in your bag to read whenever you manage to find a little downtime on the wards.
<h3>OnlineMedEd</h3>
<a href="https://onlinemeded.org/">OME</a> has a great video series, which can be useful for all of the Shelf Exams. These videos do a great job of summarizing content in an easy-to-understand way. For some students, if you're studying while tired, it may feel easier to watch videos rather than to read a book or do flashcards. (Just make sure you stay awake and pay attention!) There are also notes available for each video lecture. These are extremely high-yield, and can be a great way of reviewing important content quickly, especially right before the exam.
<h3>Step Up to Medicine</h3>
It may seem surprising that we have a medicine textbook on a list of resources for the surgery exam, but as we mentioned earlier, there's actually a lot of overlap between the Surgery Shelf and the Medicine Shelf. Studying Step Up to Medicine can be very useful for doing well on your Surgery Shelf. Keep in mind that this book is very dense with information, so it's not a crammable resource. (We don't recommend cramming anyway, for a variety of reasons!) If you want to really shine, or if you're finding yourself a little lost when dealing with the medical aspects of caring for your surgery patients, Step Up can be helpful. The sections that are most relevant are those on the cardiovascular and GI systems.
<h2>How can you create a study schedule for your Surgery Shelf Exam?</h2>
The surgery rotation tends to be one of the busiest in terms of the number of hours spent in a clinical setting. We definitely recommend scrubbing into as many surgeries as you can, and participating actively in the care of as many patients as possible. These experiences will help you learn in a lasting way, since you'll have direct experience with the information. Don't miss out on any clinical experiences in order to have more study time.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3464 size-full" src="https://www.medlearnity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_791537770.jpg" alt="Surgery Shelf exams tutor" width="1000" height="667" />

At the same time, this rotation can be one of the most difficult in terms of finding time to study. You'll need to be diligent from Day 1 about spending some of your spare time studying each day. At times, you may find it impossible to stick to your study schedule because you simply get too busy with patients. It helps to decide upon an amount of studying that you'll do per day; for example, a number of UWorld questions, or a number of pages in a textbook. This gives you a goal to aim for. If you happen to fall short on one day, just make up for it on a different day. Be flexible and don't get overwhelmed, but also stay dedicated to your studying.

Because there's so much overlap between the Medicine and Surgery Shelf Exams, students who have already done their medicine rotations tend to do better on the Surgery Shelf Exam (and in the rotation itself as well). If you're considering going into a surgical field for your residency, and you want to improve your chances of honoring your surgery rotation, then you should definitely try to do your internal medicine rotation first.
<h2>Ask for advice from others</h2>
Unless surgery is your very first clerkship, you'll likely have some friends who went through it before you did. You can ask their advice on studying for the test, but be wary of their specific subject suggestions. Recall bias makes it easier to remember the questions that felt more difficult to you, so if they say that a certain topic was overemphasized, that doesn't necessarily mean that it actually was; it might have just felt that way. Still, it can be very useful to help each other out; some students even trade books or other study resources as they switch clerkships. MS4s and residents can also be valuable sources for information about the exam.

You might also want to consider seeking professional advice. Here at Medlearnity, each of <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-tutors/">our tutors</a> has scored 250+ on <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/">Step 2 CK</a>, and is extremely well prepared to help you get ready for your Surgery Shelf Exam. Being guided by someone who has successfully navigated this process can be extremely valuable, helping to relieve stress and ensure that your study plan is as effective as possible. It's often difficult to find much time to study during the surgical rotation, so ensuring that you're efficient and that you stay on track is key.

		<title><![CDATA[What’s your USMLE Step 1 Mentality?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1>How to get your mindset right for Step 1 success</h1><p><a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-tutoring-step-1/">USMLE Step 1</a> looms large in the mind of every med student. There's a ton of pressure on you as you approach exam day. This is for good reason; your Step 1 score really matters. A good score on Step 1 makes a huge difference in giving you options for your residency, in terms of both specialty and location. (Here are the <a href="https://mk0nrmp3oyqui6wqfm.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Charting-Outcomes-in-the-Match-2020_MD-Senior_final.pdf">Match data</a> from the NRMP if you'd like to dive deeper on this; you can also learn more about <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-1-percentiles/">Step 1 percentiles</a>.)</p><p>So we've established the clear importance of Step 1. Let's put this exam into perspective, and think about the first three years of medical school and having the right mentality when it comes to this exam.</p><h2>First Year (MS1) – Fundamentals</h2><p>During your first year of med school, you'll probably see a few people in your class immediately beginning to work with Step 1 resources like First Aid. However, the truth is that at this stage, it's probably best to direct your attention to really learning the fundamentals in the courses that you're taking.</p><p>Remember that you're playing a long game. If you build a very strong foundation in anatomy, physiology, microbiology, and biochemistry, then you'll make your life much easier during your MS2 year and beyond. Don't feel like you have to do this by attending all of the lectures offered at your school. If a particular lecturer's style just doesn't work for you, then just read the chapter and take your own notes instead. Do whatever helps you learn best. Keep your focus on building that strong foundation in these subjects.</p><p>Although you're focusing on your coursework at this stage, there's an important flip side to be aware of. Don't cram for your block exams! Cramming gives you short term gain but long term pain. You may do fine on the block exam after cramming, but you won't be building that retention that you need to do well in your MS2 year and on Step 1.  Instead, focus on learning the material as efficiently as you can through active recall, to help it stick. This is the time to establish effective study habits, which will continue to serve you well over the years to come.</p><p>Tools like Anki (the flashcard app) can be useful, though you shouldn't let them become a crutch. Nothing really replaces a good old-fashioned study session: actively reading something, conceptualizing it, practicing recall, and then trying to teach it back to yourself or to a friend.</p><h2>Second Year (MS2) – Integration</h2><p>Once you start second year, you're going to feel the intensity pick up. Make sure that you keep yourself grounded. A little bit of stress is okay, but if it starts to spiral out of control, then it can be debilitating. Find ways to manage your stress levels; this will continue to be important throughout medical school and beyond.</p><p>During your MS2 year, you'll want to focus on integrating your knowledge as much as possible. Try to connect systems together, and compare/contrast diseases processes. Bring back information that you learned during MS1 and connect it into what you're learning now. Physiology, Path, and Pharm all naturally connect together, so look for those connections. The more you do this, the stronger you'll feel going into your dedicated Step 1 study period.</p><p>What about Step 1 preparation? As you start your MS2 year, it's a good idea to start doing some questions from a Qbank (such as UWorld). Don't focus on quantity, but rather on quality. In other words, don't just try to get through all of the questions as quickly as you can. Instead, go slow in the beginning, and reason through why you got a question wrong. It may be because you haven't studied that material, so go and address that. It may also be because you did study something, but you misunderstood a concept. As you approach your block exams, do Step 1 questions in that topic to confirm that you know the most testable material very well.</p><h2>Dedicated Period</h2><p>At the end of MS2 and before you begin MS3, you should have a block of time dedicated to your Step 1 study. At this point, your focus should be brushing up on your weaknesses and improving your ability to integrate everything. You'll definitely have forgotten some of the material that you learned during MS1 and even early in MS2. That's normal! If you learned them well the first time around, you'll be surprised at how much material comes back and how quickly, as you review and do questions.</p><p>If you feel particularly rusty on a few subjects, or didn't understand them the first time through, then make sure you start working on those early on in your study process. Don't try to do a deep dive during dedicated! Try to get the most important concepts down through the explanations in UWorld, Pathoma, and First Aid. If you need extra help (for example, if you have particular weaknesses, or you've fallen behind), you might want to reach out to a tutor. Make sure you do this early, so that time is on your side; also, make sure that the tutor you choose has ample experience in helping students with Step 1.</p><p>Whatever you do, don't try to cram your way through First Aid and UWorld! There's just too much material to cram. You want to focus on concepts and patterns over just pure fact cramming. This will serve you well on the exam, especially when you get to the challenging questions; having a strong grasp of the concepts is what will serve you best. It will also continue to serve you well into your clinical years.</p><p>(We'll be doing another post on how to approach your dedicated studying soon, so watch for that.)</p><h2>MS3 – Clinical</h2><p>Congrats on being done with Step 1! That's a major hurdle that you've cleared.</p><p>As you go into your clinical years, just remember that your Step 1 score is not the be-all and end-all of your medical career. It's definitely important for having flexibility in choosing your residency, but once you start your residency, being diligent during your training and learning from feedback from your attendings and colleagues is going to have a lot more impact on your career down the line. Your patients are not going to care about your Step 1 score; they will care about how you treat them and help them with their health issues.</p><p>If you feel like you underperformed on Step 1, think about how you can correct course for your Shelf Exams and Step 2 CK. You probably have an intuition about what you could have done differently. Talk this out with some of your close friends and come up with a plan so that you meet your goals the next time around.</p><h2>Are you ready for Step 1?</h2><p>If you've already taken Step 1 and have some pearls of wisdom to share, feel free to comment below. We'd love to hear from you, and other students could benefit from your knowledge!</p><p>If you feel like you could use the guidance of a tutor, the experts at Medlearnity are <a href="https://www.medlearnity.com/our-services/">here to help</a>.
