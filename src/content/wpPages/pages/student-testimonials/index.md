#### More than willing to go out of his way to help me succeed on ABIM

I had a great experience. Anthony was very knowledgeable and more than willing to go out of his way to help me succeed on ABIM. At the end of my tutoring I felt prepared going into my exam. Would definitely recommend Anthony and Medlearnity to anyone! [Reference Link](https://g.co/kgs/FQdYFy).

#### Scored my highest score so far on the ObGyn shelf...

Keith helped me immensely for my MS3 clerkship shelf exams. I struggle with NBME specifically because english is not my first language and Keith made sure to teach me how to breakdown question stems and be able to get to the correct answer. I also changed my study habits taking his advice and scored my highest score so far on the ObGyn shelf which is supposed to be a hard shelf. [Reference Link](https://g.co/kgs/BPt8bS).

#### Their assistance is worth every penny and I plan to use them in the future.

I could not have had a better experience working with Akshay and his team. They go above and beyond to help you achieve your goal of becoming a physician and prepare you to succeed. They helped me prepare for the MCAT by creating a study plan, keeping me accountable and explaining difficult topics. Their assistance is worth every penny and I plan to use them in the future for USMLE tutoring. I could not recommend the use of their services more.

#### Made all the difference in terms of my passing QE

I did horribly on ABSITE every year and chalked it up to those questions not being super clinically oriented. But to increase my odds of doing well on gen surg QE, I googled “general surgery boards tutor” and MedLearnity came up. I gave it a shot with the sample session, and was immediately blown away with how knowledgeable and patient and helpful Anthony was. He has real world surgical experience, and more importantly he understands how board examiners are likely to ask questions. He makes sure you understand why you answer things right or wrong, and if you get something right he will ask you other ways that question could be asked. Having a schedule was also really helpful, and he provides a week by week schedule that you can take or leave. In addition he has these incredible study guides that compile lots and lots of factoids into digestible tables & lists. I easily got 5-10 questions just off one of his study guides. Overall, I trusted Anthony and he really made all the difference in terms of my passing QE. He is patient, knowledgeable, personable, and really invested in your success. I will absolutely be signing up to work with him for CE. [Reference Link](https://g.co/kgs/zVuQGv).

#### Helped me gain the confidence I needed for STEP 3

Medlearnity and Anthony helped me gain the confidence I needed for STEP 3 as I was attempting to complete/pass before Residency. Organized, assignments/goals, and personal tips, anecdotes that were helpful, catering to my needs. Thanks, Anthony! [Reference Link](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/626cb89bf03a9893e97f5774).

#### Thanks to his guidance, my CK score was 30 points higher than my Step 1 mark! I strongly recommend Medlearnity

I worked with my tutor for my Step 2 CK for the past 4 months. Throughout the process, he completely changed my way of approaching questions! Even though there was an adjustment period, his techniques proved to be extremely helpful and useful. He was also extremely patient and understanding throughout the entire process. His explanations of medical concepts and problems were very clear and thorough. He was also motivating with his frequent check-ins, which ensured that I gave my maximum effort on a daily basis. Thanks to his guidance, my CK score was 30 points higher than my Step 1 mark! I strongly recommend Medlearnity! [Reference Link](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/64bde837f6bc322f521a3031).

#### Worthwhile Experience

I worked with Anthony at Medlearnity and it was absolutely worth the experience. I was struggling to pass my exam and after working with him, I have finally passed it. He has broad knowledge base. He not only gave me tips on time management on the exam but also how to interpret the questions to answer them correctly. We went over a few topics but mostly practiced doing questions, which was worthwhile at the end. [Reference Link](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/61e993dae1196e51d76a053b).

#### I took this course in preparation for the ABFM.

I took this course in preparation for the ABFM. Anthony was incredibly knowledgable regarding the test content itself as well as test taking strategies. He was able to provide guidance regarding test question prompts and rationalizing the "best option".

#### MedLearnity is the absolute best resource when it comes to residency consulting.

MedLearnity is the absolute best resource when it comes to residency consulting. I was able to get into a residency program after several cycles of not matching. I cannot say enough good things about them and Radhika specifically. With her help, I was able to write a compelling personal statement, craft the perfect CV, and polish my application so that each would highlight my strengths and illustrate why I would be an asset to any program. Radhika helped me develop the best strategy for applying to programs based on my competitiveness. She also helped me to practice for my interviews, including brainstorming answers to many of the common (and not so common) questions I would encounter during the interview cycle. She conducted mock interviews with me and gave me honest feedback on how I did afterward. She also advised me on communicating effectively what I have to offer as a candidate and why I would be a great fit for each program.Residency is very competitive, and it's getting worse every year, unfortunately. We have more medical school slots than ever due to healthcare expansion from the ACA. However, we have not increased the number of residency slots to a requisite level due to a continued cap on federal funding of GME programs through Medicare (despite a looming doctor shortage of up to 125,000 over the next ten years). As medical students, we're often racked with self-doubt and imposter syndrome, wondering if we're good enough. Often, we need help to draw out all the positive traits within us to convey them to a program and show what makes us a great candidate. This is how MedLearnity helps.What I also like about it is that it's all-encompassing (mock interviews, application assistance, personal statement assistance, including brainstorming, editing, and revision, as well as general advice and strategy for applying to programs, letters of intent, advice on matching, etc.). The assistance is personalized to whatever your needs are, and they are always there to support you throughout the process (from the beginning of admission season till match day). They will answer any questions you have along the way, at any time, via email and respond promptly with no additional cost. With their help, I was able to get into my dream program. This was the best investment I could have made. If you're interested, I would suggest you reach out to them. They even offer a free trial session, which is informative in and of itself. During the session, they can give you an honest assessment of your competitiveness (including step scores, etc.) and develop an individualized residency plan that you can utilize should you decide to move forward. I didn't have the opportunity to use their Step exam tutoring services. I wasn't aware of MedLearnity before taking them, but if I was, I definitely would have utilized them as well.

#### I am happy to report that not only did I pass Step 1 with a much stronger score, but, even after we stopped working together, I continued to use his strategies as I prepared for subsequent tests and recently aced my specialty boards.

I initially worked with Akshay a few years ago after I had failed Step 1. We worked together via video chat which worked out great for both of our busy schedules and allowed Akshay to utilize technology to enhance my learning experience. Each session, Akshay used technology creatively to track my progress, to address my personal weaknesses and then to build skills and techniques to target my individual needs. Akshay is compassionate and patient with his students; he greatly improved my confidence as a test taker and helped me strengthen my knowledge base. I am happy to report that not only did I pass Step 1 with a much stronger score, but, even after we stopped working together, I continued to use his strategies as I prepared for subsequent tests and recently aced my specialty boards. I've worked with various tutors throughout my life and I would definitely say that Akshay stands out as unique. Akshay is clearly passionate about teaching and I would recommend him highly to anyone who is struggling or just looking to improve their score or medical knowledge.

#### I ended up passing CK with a score that I was really happy with and matched into residency.

I was having a lot of difficulties with USMLE Step 2 CK. I had reached a point where I had thought that I had peaked since my practice scores weren't improving after having already completed UWorld. They helped me with my approach to the questions and taught me methods to better retain what I was learning over longer periods of time. My tutor even helped me prioritize my learning and continued to work with me to create an adaptive study schedule that fit my lifestyle. It really improved my confidence with my knowledge which was reflected in the scores I was seeing. I ended up passing CK with a score that I was really happy with and matched into residency. I never hesitate to recommend their services to anyone I think might benefit. [Reference Link](https://g.co/kgs/YzAg2K).

#### I totally wish I knew about Medlearnity earlier

I totally wish I knew about Medlearnity earlier!The ABR CORE radiology examination was an absolute beast! I took the exam more than once, and my frustration, discouragement, and anxiety grew exponentially with each attempt. I had studied all the same videos, books, apps and Q-banks that all my colleagues had (several times). I often heard people say, "Oh, just study this - this - and this. That's what I did. You'll be fine." But it was never enough for me to pass. I needed help!I realized that formal tutor options were hard to find for a specific/high level exam, like the CORE. In my online search, I came across Medlearnity, and sent them an email to see if they could point me in the right direction. Within 48 hours I was on the phone with Akshay, who had passed the CORE exam himself is exceptionally qualified as a tutor! Together we mapped out a study plan, using his "Task Manager." He introduced me to the Remnote tool, which is much more effective than traditional flashcards. He also recommended a few particular review series and case books. We spent time walking through these books together, specifically in my weaker subjects. Akshay put me in touch with Louis, who is also a phenomenal CORE tutor! Our sessions together were productive, emphasizing the high-yield concepts. Not only did I pass, but I passed in the categories I'd struggled with the most. If you're going to take the CORE exam, don't hesitate to reach out to Medlearnity.I totally recommend them, and the sooner the better. You'll be glad you did.

#### After just a few months of online tutoring services with Akshay, I successfully passed Step 1 with significant improvement compared to my prior failed attempts.

Akshay is a very patient tutor who focuses on strengthening an individual's weaknesses to promote a successful outcome, whether their weaknesses be timing, fund of knowledge, poor sleeping habits, level of testing anxiety or a combination of the above. I personally struggled with the Step 1 Medical exam and sought out help. I was fortunate enough to work with Akshay who focused on me as a whole rather than just the fund of knowledge. After just a few months of online tutoring services with Akshay, I successfully passed Step 1 with significant improvement compared to my prior failed attempts. I was able to use the tools and skills learned during our sessions to successfully complete the remaining Medical Step exams allowing me to continue on the path of pursuing my goal of being a Pediatrician. After my success, I referred my friend to work with him and she had similar success.

#### My advisor Kush helped me with every step of the journey.

I had an excellent experience with Medlearnity when applying to residency. They were always very nice, professional, and flexible. My advisor Kush helped me with every step of the journey whether it be with my application, interview preparation, or with my rank order list. I cannot recommend them highly enough.

#### I passed my general surgery oral board exam in one try with Anthony’s help at Medlearnity

I passed my general surgery oral board exam in one try with Anthony’s help at Medlearnity!I am so excited and so relieved to have passed and be DONE. I went into my exam knowing I’ve gone through every testable subject inside and out multiple times and knowing that I was well trained with the oral examination format. Anthony was my secret weapon. Before reaching out to Medlearnity, I looked at some oral board prep books and video prep, and I felt really overwhelmed. To add, I was also newly graduated, moved twice, transitioning from doing locums to a perm position, undergoing significant life changes, working long hours, and being chronically sleep deprived…all the good stuff is new attendings go through..so the pathway to taking the boards seemed very intimidating to me at the time. Working with Anthony helped me prepare in an effective and efficient way. I cannot thank him enough for helping me feel confident on test day and that confidence has transcended into my surgical practice. Thanks to him for everything. I highly recommend.

#### I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who wants help learning invaluable skills for taking medical examinations

I used Medlearnity over the course of six months to help prepare me for Step 1. In the past I have struggled with standardized tests and knew I would need help to achieve the competitive score I desired. Dr. Goel and Dustin were both incredible mentors and teachers! Dustin explained difficult concepts clearly and thoroughly during every session. He was always available to answer questions in-between sessions and helped me identify weaknesses in my knowledge and test-taking abilities. During my dedicated study period, Dr. Goel called me often to check on my progress, and provided me with invaluable tips and tricks to reduce my test anxiety. I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who wants help learning invaluable skills for taking medical examinations

#### He helped me create a schedule that was realistic for my study needs and availability.

Akshay was excellent. He was organized, flexible, and respectful of my time and money. He helped me create a schedule that was realistic for my study needs and availability. Akshay knew the material and more importantly, knew where to direct my efforts in test taking skills. I will absolutely be hiring Akshay again in the future.

#### My score on the shelf was much higher...

I worked with Victoria for OBGYN shelf and really enjoyed my time with her. Through her sessions, I really became comfortable with the OBGYN shelf material. Shelf exams are extremely difficult, but Victoria not only ensures you have the content knowledge down, but she also makes sure you know how to approach questions properly. She also helped with recommendations of study tools as well that helped me prepare for exam.My score on the shelf was much higher and I believe that has to do with the tutoring I received from Victoria.

#### Anthony’s experience in surgery... helped me hone in on my strengths

In the words of Serena Williams and Billie-Jean King, “Pressure is a privilege.” I agree completely, but when it comes to the ABSITE, the privilege of being a surgical resident can feel a bit more pressure-like. Thank you to Anthony and the Medlearnity Team for providing professional, reliable assistance in a time of need. Standardized tests never come easy to me, and of course, I ended up choosing a career that is chock full of standardized testing. The ABSITE is a tough exam, is comprehensive in the topics covered, and is proctored in the midst of working an intense surgical resident schedule. Anthony’s experience in surgery, in test-taking, and test- creating helped me hone in on my strengths, hone in even more importantly on my gaps in knowledge, and truly understand how to focus my study efforts. He provided real time feedback about my thought process in regards to specific practice questions. He provided knowledge about the nuances in a question stem and the respective answer choices to help me successfully answer. He helped me understand the highest yield concepts that would help me succeed on exam day. He provided engaging, effective sessions that accommodated my scheduled, no matter what time of day. I felt supported during the entire time I was working with Anthony and the Medlearnity Team, and I can’t thank everyone enough for the help.

This is the first year I have taken the exam where I felt like I knew more of the answers than not, and it proved to be a much less stressful testing experience overall. Knowledge is power, and Anthony definitely helped me increase my knowledge exponentially, not only to succeed on the ABSITE, but as a surgeon as well.

Thank you for everything
VH, PGY-3, General Surgery

#### Through his help I went from failing USMLE Step 1 to getting my number one residency in my chosen specialty.

Akshay is not only an expert in medical knowledge, but also a master educator who knows exactly how to tailor lesson plans to maximize retention, recall, and deep understanding of complex topics. Through his help I went from failing USMLE Step 1 to getting my number one residency in my chosen specialty. If I'd have found him sooner, I would have saved many hours and hundreds of dollars wasted on less worthy educational resources that I tried, including Kaplan and Doctors in Training. Now as a resident in clinical practice, the learning habits he taught me help me excel far beyond my peers. His methodology the epitome of "high-yield" learning. If you want the easiest, most efficient and most entertaining path to medical mastery, look no further

#### Excellent Experience

I found MedLearnity as a junior level surgery resident seeking a tutor to help me learn advanced medical and surgical concepts. I had an initial phone conversation with Akshay who connected me with Anthony. Anthony is a great tutor, and I highly recommend him to other residents who are interested in learning and increasing their knowledge base. He always puts a lot of thought into preparing his lessons, and I am always comfortable in asking questions if I don't understand a concept. In addition, Anthony is always available and engaging. He's helped prepare for multiple exams and is one of the best tutors that I’ve had. [Reference Link](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/618c7ebffb38891f5f0817b7).

#### Sadjad is EXCEPTIONAL as both a person and a teacher.

I have worked with multiple tutors from med Learnity for step 1 & the medicine shelf. I likely would not have made it this far without them. Every tutor I have worked with has been extremely knowledgable & has an amazing understanding of all the concepts of medicine. I have never had people answer my questions so well until I started working with med Learnity. Additionally, one of my biggest challenges is test anxiety and timing. Each of my tutors went out their way to keep adjusting our preparation techniques until I was able to succeed. They would even talk to me about struggles in life and how to overcome them to maintain focus on school. Lastly, med school is long and can cause burn out. The team wants you to succeed and will keep you accountable. They reignited my passion for medicine and kept me on track. I highly highly highly recommend med Learnity if you are struggling passing step 1 or a shelf. If you put in the work with them, you will succeed (if I can do it, trust me anyone can!!). The most recent tutor I had was Sadjad who is EXCEPTIONAL as both a person and a teacher. While med Learnity is expensive, it is an investment in your future and they will get you where you want to be.

#### Highly recommend for USMLE exams

Medlearnity is an incredibly well organized and effective program. I was looking to improve my Step 1 score and worried that I was starting to delve into my studying at too late of a time and needed help in catching me up. Sadjad tutored me for Step 1, and I greatly benefited from the personalized sessions we had. He always came prepared to our meetings with topics, questions and useful tips that really helped to elevate my score. Everyone a part of the Medlearnity team was so kind, promptly communicated with me and made the process seamless. I also enjoyed the supplemental materials they provided students and found them to be more useful than other resources. I would highly recommend this service for a Step 1 tutor!

Anthony is an amazing tutor. He explains things in a way that anyone can understand and has many tricks to remember the small details. I have never been a strong test taker, but with this tutoring, I nearly doubled my percentile on absite. Highly recommend

#### Huge difference during my MS3 clerkship shelf exams

Keith from Medlearnity made a huge difference during my MS3 clerkship shelf exams. He helped me breakdown NBME english and get to the right answer. I was able to score my highest score on ObGyn shelf so far. And I will continue to study from him for Step 2. He's an excellent tutor, he is always on time and well prepared. He knows his stuff really well and is able to guide me through each concept really understanding where I go wrong even when I don't know it myself sometimes. He is great.

#### Wonderful tool for Step 1 preparation

Wonderful tool for Step 1 preparationMedlearnity was a key piece of studying for my Step 1 exam. What I really struggled with was knowing how to formulate a schedule and set up a plan. I was paired with a 4th year medical student as a tutor who had already gone through the step exams and was able to connect with me and help identify my weaknesses. It is as customizable as you would like it to be and they check in on you to make sure you're progressing! [Reference Link](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/62d5baa91574b2001338147d).

#### 5 Stars

MedLearnity is an outstanding tutoring service that improved my step 1 score by 50 points!They are professional, intelligent, and most of all excited to help you on your journey. I worked with the MedLearnity tutors twice a week and they communicate high yield content effectively and efficiently. They invested time answering my questions on pathophysiology and provided great rationale. [Reference Link](https://g.co/kgs/yRzF3j).Before MedLearnity I was in the bottom 30% of my class, after buying in and investing time my scores course scores improved to near the top 30%. I attribute this med school turn around to the MedLearnity Team

#### By the end of medical school, I had 38 interview invitations from Internal Medicine programs throughout the country, the highest number of interview invitations for my medical school class.

Throughout medical school, my ambitions had always been high but my test taking skills, not always the best. Working with Akshay provided a transformative experience. I had my first session with him while preparing for Step 1, and I have never looked back. Akshay offers a very structured, detailed, and personalized study plan that helped improve my fund of knowledge on a daily basis. During our one on one study sessions, he would be sure to break down complex physiological concepts and focus on subject areas that needed improvement. We would work through test taking strategies that were practical and quickly helped turn around my practice test scores. Thanks to Akshay, my Step 1 Score opened the door to a world of opportunities. To continue this pattern of success, I returned to Akshay for both Step 2 CK and CS. The results of Akshay's training were remarkable. After undergrad, I had only 2 medical school interviews, primarily because of poor test taking. By the end of medical school, I had 38 interview invitations from Internal Medicine programs throughout the country, the highest number of interview invitations for my medical school class. Fortunately, I matched into my number 1 residency program at Johns Hopkins. I would recommend Akshay to anyone looking for a tried and tested strategy for success on the USMLE. More importantly, I thank him for giving me the tools to become a better doctor.

#### I don't have enough good things to say about the Medlearnity team.

I don't have enough good things to say about the Medlearnity team. Their one-on-one coaching enabled me to not only pass my board exams, but to excel at them. Each tutor I worked with listened to my specific needs and concerns to curate a study plan for me based on my specific learning style and strengths. Each tutor was kind and patient and explained things concisely and effectively. Akshay himself is an excellent educator and compassionate soul. He repeatedly takes time out of his day to answer phone calls, emails, and texts from worried students; he listens and offers comforting reassurance along with guidance. My time spent with the Medlearnity team was invaluable. I recommend them to anyone I know going through this exam process! [Reference Link](https://g.co/kgs/KgEJrJ).

#### I cannot recommend him enough.

I worked with Akshay and would highly recommend him! He was very accommodating of my busy school schedule. He was also very organized and had so many creative ways to learn the material. He was also incredibly smart. I cannot recommend him enough.

#### Mission accomplished. I'm very happy with the results.

This is the second exam that I have done with Medlearnity and it has been another amazing experience. I didn't receive a passing score on my PGY-1 and PGY-2 ITE's, likely due to not feeling motivated to study. I needed someone to keep me on a consistent study schedule, but also someone who could explain concepts to me that I felt weak in. I worked with Amelia for about 9 months to prepare for the American Board of Family Medicine exam. We had one 2 hour session a week. She was actually a resident, not in Family Medicine, but her breadth of knowledge was so impressive. Going over questions with her was very helpful. I felt that she was very relatable as a resident because if I expressed my frustration about my incorrect answer based on my experience, she could relay her experience in a similar scenario and combine it with her evidence based/guideline knowledge to help me understand. Sometimes it just felt like I was working with this incredible upper level. She also prepares topics to discuss to make sure that we go over a few key learning points each session on top of the questions that we do. Everything she teaches is very practical and exam oriented. No garbage. No extraneous information. No wasted time. I really appreciated how flexible she was with her schedule for me. My schedule changed every month and sometimes I wouldn't know it until a few days in advance, but it was never any problem. She's also very very nice and so easy to work with and talk to. Akshay was also really good about occasionally checking in on me to make sure that everything was going well with the sessions. Even though I never had any complaints, he would make sure that I felt comfortable to let him know if I had any issues. I feel that Medlearnity would be very easy to work with if I had ended up with a tutor that did not fit my learning style well. I really lucked out with Amelia though because she was exactly the tutor I was looking for. The preliminary results say I passed! So mission accomplished. I'm very happy with the results.

#### With Akshay's help and support, I was able to successfully pass Step 2 CK by a good margin and ended up matching into a University residency program.

When I failed the USMLE Step 2 CK, I was concerned that I had reached my peak in knowledge retention. Leading up to the exam, I had read from multiple sources and completed over 2000 practice questions. Still, I felt unprepared to make a second attempt and was afraid I would never pass the exam. As a last effort, I decided to get a tutor.

Starting from my very first session with Akshay, I knew that he was the right tutor for me--one who would be able to guide me through what I had yet to learn. He dissected the way I had been approaching questions, refined my study schedule, and gave me tips on how to become more efficient. He taught me methods that helped drastically increase my ability to retain information. He also streamlined my studying so that I wasted less time on the unimportant things. Besides all that, Akshay was a great source of motivation and confidence.

With Akshay's help and support, I was able to successfully pass Step 2 CK by a good margin and ended up matching into a University residency program. I now apply his methods to all of my learning and never hesitate to recommend him to people I know.

#### After having my dedicated period extended due to COVID...

After having my dedicated period extended due to COVID, I felt uncertain about the progress I had made and seemed to be in a firm rut with my studying. Dr. Goel and my tutor, Dustin, helped put me on a schedule to cover everything that I needed. They stayed in constant communication and made sure I had what I needed to succeed. In the tutoring sessions, we covered questions created by my tutor and discussed the main points of each. We also discussed test taking strategies, how to approach questions, and test day advice. Overall, I believe that I benefitted greatly from this service. I appreciate that they have a trial lesson, so you can find out if this program is right for you.

#### Great Experience

I was constantly being taught high-yield information. Anthony kept reinforcing the information I was not grasping right away, and he sensed that. He provided grafts, charts, and other methods of learning to solidify the important concepts. I was given recordings of our sessions, and I will have so much material to use from this point on (I'm a PGY1, and this is an incredible foundation).

I used Medlearnity for my USMLE Step 1 exam and I had a great experience. The tutors were super helpful and were always very flexible and patient. Smrithi and Viemma in particular were amazing! I would recommend Medlearnity to anyone who is in need of extra help when preparing for any exam. [Reference Link](https://g.co/kgs/EmSSCa).

#### "Passed ABIM Boards"

After failing ABIM a few times and trying different review courses, I decided to try Medlearnity.Dr. Anthony was my tutor for ABIM. He was extremely knowledgeable and resourceful. His tutoring method, calm approach to questions, consistency and reliability, clearly played a huge role in my passing the ABIM. He was not flying through topics and questions just for the sake of completing questions; He was astute and would circle back to concepts and questions that I was weak at and continue to address them hence giving me a solid knowledge base. He was prompt, available, and responded immediately to my emails however trivial they were. He was professional and ethical. When doing questions, he would have me explain why the right answer was right and the wrong answers were wrong, this way he would fill in the knowledge gaps and give me a mini-tutor on the subject. It was worth it.Medlearnity office staff were sincerely nice, flexible, and informative.Medlearnity company has integrity and ethical culture. I would recommend them to anybody studying for Step 3, ITE, and definitely ABIM Boards. [Reference Link](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6174b2c07f369f0012840938).

#### He is a great tutor and one I'd highly recommend to anyone.

Anthony tutored me for Step 3 when I had been out of medical school for 3 years and of the clinical setting as well. It was important to me that someone teaching me would be supportive and encouraging about the wrong answers and reasonings I would make during this process and Anthony was exactly that. Because of my traveling schedule, Anthony had to be extremely flexible with our tutoring schedule, and he was always genuinely caring about whether I could make the time as well. I've only worked with Anthony on Step 3, but it is apparent to me that he teaches other topics in medicine as well. He is a great tutor and one I'd highly recommend to anyone.

#### Anthony was a great resource for my prep.

Anthony was a great resource for my prep. We got through a ton of questions each session that were high yield and he did a great job of maintaining repetition of weak areas in subsequent sessions. He was also good in testing me on the spot with various facts that could be related to the question at hand and the different ways a concept could be tested. The only qualm I had was the delayed notice/process of finding a substitute with the company when he was unavailable. Highly recommend him as a tutor - was one of the best I've worked with.

They are an amazing professionals, with an outstanding comprhension about the process. They help you through set your bases in knowledge and as person. They help you to build strenght, self confident and resiliance in the journey. This attention is personalized and specific on your needs. My personal expierence I failed couple NBME's and I though I never was going to made it for the step 1. Smrithi help me with my test taking skills and how to approach the questions and keep calm during exams. I pass my step 1 in my first attempt, after 4 months of tutoring. I totally recomend them as a tutoring system and more important the quality of the persons that works here.

#### Significant improvements

I used Medlearnity and Anthony to prepare for my ABSITE and it made a massive difference. The guidance on what to focus on, tutor session personalized to my weakness, and the study aids that were provided me allowed me to increase from 20% percentile to 70%. It made a massive difference in my future. I will definitely use them again. [Reference Link](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/624455802b3c3c43cfc35596).

#### Blown away with how knowledgeable and patient and helpful Anthony was.

I failed my written boards first try and was lost as to how to improve my odds for the second attempt. I googled “general surgery boards tutor” and MedLearnity came up. I gave it a shot with the sample session, and was immediately blown away with how knowledgeable and patient and helpful Anthony was. He has real world surgical experience, and more importantly he understands how board examiners are likely to ask questions. He makes sure you understand why you answer things right or wrong, and if you get something right he will ask you other ways that question could be asked. Having a schedule was also really helpful, and he provides a week by week schedule that you can take or leave. In addition he has these incredible study guides that compile lots and lots of factoids into digestible tables & lists. I easily got 5-10 questions just off one of his study guides. Overall, I trusted Anthony and he really made all the difference in terms of my passing this second time. He is patient, knowledgeable, personable, and really invested in your success. I will absolutely be signing up to work with him for oral boards.

#### For anyone who needs that extra guidance and help for step 1 and step 2

There are not enough words to express my gratitude for Akshay and his team. I used tutors through medlearnity for step 1 and step 2. I worked with Henry throughout most of second year tutoring for step 1. My institution did a poor job preparing for step 1, but with Henry's help and guidance I was able to pass step 1. Throughout 3rd year I tutoring with Radhika for my shelf exam. SHE IS AN AMAZING TUTOR! After a few lesson she seemed to understand my learning style and catering to it. Right before my internal medicine shelf, I got a concussion. She worked around my schedule and was so supportive. Seriously without her, I wouldn't have been able to get through my concussion on top of a worldwide pandemic. Leading up to step 2, I worked with Isao along with Radhika. They started to help me with strategy more than content. Leading up towards test day I felt more confident that I ever had with the help of this team. Akshay is an amazing educator who truly cares about his students! I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who needs that extra guidance and help for step 1 and step 2.

#### Provided reliability in my life during medical school

My experience with Medlearnity has been great so far as they have provided reliability in my life during medical school. Sadjad was a great teacher who provided me with knowledge, feedback, and support. He taught me the importance of having a support system for exam taking, which helped me understand why my scores don’t justify my knowledge of a subject despite my hard work and effort. Sadjad was very patient with me and dissected my maladaptive test taking habits while observing me answer exam questions. Most of all, he spent a lot of time providing care and support throughout the process, which reduced my anxiety, helped me gain confidence in my own abilities to strengthen my weaknesses, and raise my score two standard deviations. Overall, Sadjad is a very well trained and knowledgeable physician who was able to teach me by customizing the subject to my individual level of understanding.

#### Tool to consider in the toolbox of preparation for boards.

Medlearnity is definitely a tool to consider in the toolbox of preparation for boards. I can only speak for my tutor but he was very approachable, available , and helped to nail down those hard to wrap your head around concepts. The program was easy to navigate overall. Definitely not a substitute for question banks but a great adjunct to board studies. Will definitely be using it again next time boards come around.

#### Great Resource for the Radiology CORE Exam

I had a great experience studying for the radiology CORE exam with the resources provided by Medlearnity. I did not pass the exam on my first try and reached out to Medlearnity for help. Working with my tutor Louis was a phenomenal experience. I had most of the knowledge of the material, but Louis was able to help with strategies and test-taking skills that helped me pass the second time. Louis is very experienced as he helped many others with this exam. Doing questions and learning how to think through them as well as understanding how the material can be asked were very helpful to my success. If I was to do it all over again, I would have used Medlearnity sooner. Thank you Medlearnity

Andjela at Medlearnity was a great tutor. She budgeted time well by clarifying with me how we were going to run the session and then jam packing each question with high yield tips, and providing ideas on how to cement rote memorization things like vaccines and USPSTF guidelines.I passed my FMed shelf exam, exceeding the minimum score by 15 points with her help.

#### I likely would not have made it this far without them.

I have worked with multiple tutors from med Learnity for step 1 & the medicine shelf. I likely would not have made it this far without them. Every tutor I have worked with has been extremely knowledgable & has an amazing understanding of all the concepts of medicine. I have never had people answer my questions so well until I started working with med Learnity. Additionally, one of my biggest challenges is test anxiety and timing. Each of my tutors went out their way to keep adjusting our preparation techniques until I was able to succeed. They would even talk to me about struggles in life and how to overcome them to maintain focus on school. Lastly, med school is long and can cause burn out. The team wants you to succeed and will keep you accountable. They reignited my passion for medicine and kept me on track. I highly highly highly recommend med Learnity if you are struggling passing step 1 or a shelf. If you put in the work with them, you will succeed (if I can do it, trust me anyone can!!). The most recent tutor I had was Sadjad who is EXCEPTIONAL as both a person and a teacher. While med Learnity is expensive, it is an investment in your future and they will get you where you want to be. [Reference Link](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/607063b1f85d750870526c7d).

#### I am forever grateful for their dedication in helping me pass.

Dr. Goel and his tutors are life savers. I could not have passed my step 3 without them!!! I improved from 190 to 220. The tutors are highly qualified and really good at figuring out your strength and weakness and finding ways to overcome your weakness during the tutoring sessions. More importantly, they are always willing to work around your schedule. The tutors taught me the best strategies to tackle each questions and use effective techniques to look at the minor details which I was ignoring earlier and could not catch with my untrained eyes. Hence, I was getting a lot of the questions wrong. I was tutored for 30 hours and with each session my coannfidence and test taking strategies vastly improved. Within a month, I made a lot of improvement. I am forever grateful for their dedication in helping me pass. Dr. Geol was always a phone call or text away advising me, helping me calm my nerves before the exam. I can't thank them enough. I highly recommend them. They also offer financial aid/loan through a third party incase the money is an issue for you.

#### I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them.

I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them. The tutoring really helped me through the daunting task of preparing for the exam, and preparing for future standardized testing as well. I was assigned a tutor for the ACM -type questions and biostats, as well as a second tutor for CCS. I also received significant, and much needed coaching from Dr. Gohel, so I actually had a team of 3 doctors helping me prep. An amazing team, sure to get even the busiest scalpel back to razor sharpness

#### Dr. Goel is an amazing tutor and he will bring out the very best in anyone with whom he works. His services will be a remarkable asset to any exam preparation plan and he has the experience and results that attest to this.

I am a US medical school graduate who has a very difficult time with standardized testing. So much so that initially, I did not pass the second part of the USMLE exam (STEP 2 CK.) I found out about Dr. Goel's tutoring through a friend who used him for her USMLE test preparation. During our initial meeting, I knew he was the perfect tutor for my needs. He was able to accurately assess my strengths and weakness based on our personal interaction rather than assume what I needed according to my previous score. This was essential to the services he rendered because he quickly determined that I had a wealth of knowledge suitable for this exam but my test-taking skills were the source of my issues.

Dr. Goel created a plan that accurately and efficiently addressed the weaknesses in my testing skills. His program included optimizing the use of Anki, which is an electronic note card program, a special strategy to approach the multiple choice questions on USMLE boards, and reviewing material from common board prep question banks. He also designed a pacing system to help me stay on track with timing for each question and he would select various topics for us to discuss the pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and treatment in order to ensure comprehensive understanding of key medical presentations even beyond the board exam.

Overall, Dr. Goel's support and interest in my immediate and long term goals were exemplary. With his strategic and specific approach, I was able to pass STEP 2 CK with a score that increased by more than 30 points. The results speak for themselves! Dr. Goel is an amazing tutor and he will bring out the very best in anyone with whom he works. His services will be a remarkable asset to any exam preparation plan and he has the experience and results that attest to this. I am truly grateful that I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Goel and I enthusiastically recommend him as an integral component to your medical exam study plan

#### Personalized Tutoring Unlike Any Other

I have turned to Medlearnity after studying for STEP1 by on my own for 6 weeks. Immediately, I felt supported and was impressed with the tutor's preparation for each session. I was so used to having to come up with questions, but it was SO refreshing that Medlearnity tutors come prepared with high yield concepts from reputable question banks. From the beginning, I was impressed with Dr. Goel's personalization and his responsiveness to my needs. While I was working with Ben (who is amazing!), Dr. Goel always knew the pertinent information that was discussed in each session and I took so much comfort in the fact that he is invested in my success. Dr. Goel was very encouraging and have frequently checked-in with me to make sure I am on-track.

I really enjoyed working with Ben! This exam brought forth so much stress but he had such a calming presence and kept me grounded throughout the ups and downs of STEP1. He is dedicated, brilliant, selfless, and hardworking - even on days when he had a really long shift, he made himself available so that I hone my weaknesses in the limited time that I had before my exam. He is truly a gem and I have recommended him to many of my friends! STEP1 is an incredibly lonely time filled with solo studying and I always looked forward to sessions with Ben. He allowed me to think out loud and correct my thinking process so that I can strategically tackle questions.

However, at the end of the day, it is up to each student to put in the work, identify weaknesses, and maintain resilience to get through this exam. While I do not think tutoring was the sole reason for my success on STEP1, it definitely helped to hone in on my weaknesses and gave me the motivation to get through the challenges of this exam. If you are looking for a personalized tutoring experience after feeling stuck on an attempt to self-study, I highly recommend MedLearnity
