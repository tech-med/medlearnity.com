Our satisfied students speak for themselves.

I was having a lot of difficulties with USMLE Step 2 CK. I had reached a point where I had thought that I had peaked since my practice scores weren't improving after having already completed UWorld. They helped me with my approach to the questions and taught me methods to better retain what I was learning over longer periods of time. My tutor even helped me prioritize my learning and continued to work with me to create an adaptive study schedule that fit my lifestyle. It really improved my confidence with my knowledge which was reflected in the scores I was seeing. I ended up passing CK with a score that I was really happy with and matched into residency. I never hesitate to recommend their services to anyone I think might benefit.

**Michael Yeung****Step 2 CK student**

There are not enough words to express my gratitude for Akshay and his team. I used tutors through medlearnity for step 1 and step 2. I worked with Henry throughout most of second year tutoring for step 1. My institution did a poor job preparing for step 1, but with Henry's help and guidance I was able to pass step 1

Throughout 3rd year I tutoring with Radhika for my shelf exam. SHE IS AN AMAZING TUTOR! After a few lesson she seemed to understand my learning style and catering to it. Right before my internal medicine shelf, I got a concussion. She worked around my schedule and was so supportive. Seriously without her, I wouldn't have been able to get through my concussion on top of a worldwide pandemic.

Leading up to step 2, I worked with Isao along with Radhika. They started to help me with strategy more than content. Leading up towards test day I felt more confident that I ever had with the help of this team.

Akshay is an amazing educator who truly cares about his students! I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who needs that extra guidance and help for step 1 and step 2.

## If any of the above statements sound like you, we want you to know that you’re not alone!

Thousands of med students take the USMLE every year. Many of them struggle to get the scores that they want. The USMLE is widely considered to be the most difficult set of exams in the country. The overwhelming responsibilities of med school and intern year can make it difficult to find the time to study, and using the wrong study strategies can make your limited study time less effective.

## Your performance on the USMLE is one of the most important factors in determining which residency program you match with.

Data from the NRMP (the National Residency Matching Program, the program that administers the Match) indicate that residency directors rank applicant’s scores on USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK among the most important factors in determining who gets invited for an interview. Your performance on these exams could determine whether you even get a chance to interview at the program of your choice.

Residency directors give a lot of weight to USMLE scores, because they’re standardized and easily comparable across different med schools. This gives them a unique weight in your residency application.If you’re planning to apply for a fellowship after your residency, then your Step 3 scores will also become important in your application. At the same time, Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores continue to be important even into fellowship. This is why it’s crucial to achieve the best possible scores on these exams; a less-than-stellar performance on Step 1 or Step 2 CK could put limits on your career choices years later.Your USMLE scores are crucial to your future in medicine. Your choice of specialty, residency location, and other program specifics depends heavily on your USMLE scores.

## The good news is that your performance on the USMLE is largely under your control.

**You can achieve a great USMLE score.** 

**You can match with the residency program of your choice.**

**You just need the right strategy to help you succeed.**
