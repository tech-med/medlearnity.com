## We’ve helped over 500 students prepare for their high-stakes medical exams

Our satisfied students speak for themselves:

Anthony has done an amazing job preparing me for my ABSITE exam. He was always punctual and encouraging for all of my 20hours of private lessons! He really catered to my weaknesses and helped really elaborate on concepts to help further my knowledge. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for tutoring. I'm extremely grateful to him and the whole Medlearnity team for continuously checking up on my progress.

!Peter I.ABSITE Student

I was constantly being taught high-yield information. Anthony kept reinforcing the information I was not grasping right away, and he sensed that. He provided grafts, charts, and other methods of learning to solidify the important concepts. I was given recordings of our sessions, and I will have so much material to use from this point on (I'm a PGY1, and this is an incredible foundation).

!Blake C.ABSITE Student

In the words of Serena Williams and Billie-Jean King, “Pressure is a privilege.” I agree completely, but when it comes to the ABSITE, the privilege of being a surgical resident can feel a bit more pressure-like. Thank you to Anthony and the Medlearnity Team for providing professional, reliable assistance in a time of need. Standardized tests never come easy to me, and of course, I ended up choosing a career that is chock full of standardized testing. The ABSITE is a tough exam, is comprehensive in the topics covered, and is proctored in the midst of working an intense surgical resident schedule. Anthony’s experience in surgery, in test-taking, and test- creating helped me hone in on my strengths, hone in even more importantly on my gaps in knowledge, and truly understand how to focus my study efforts. He provided real time feedback about my thought process in regards to specific practice questions. He provided knowledge about the nuances in a question stem and the respective answer choices to help me successfully answer. He helped me understand the highest yield concepts that would help me succeed on exam day. He provided engaging, effective sessions that accommodated my scheduled, no matter what time of day. I felt supported during the entire time I was working with Anthony and the Medlearnity Team, and I can’t thank everyone enough for the help.

This is the first year I have taken the exam where I felt like I knew more of the answers than not, and it proved to be a much less stressful testing experience overall. Knowledge is power, and Anthony definitely helped me increase my knowledge exponentially, not only to succeed on the ABSITE, but as a surgeon as well. 

Thank you for everything

## Which ABS Exams Do We Offer Tutoring For?

#### ABS In-Training Exam (ABSITE)

The ABSITE is offered annually to residents in general surgery, and has a significant impact on resident promotion. The exam tests the gains that residents have achieved in their knowledge of medical science and management of clinical problems related to surgical procedures.

#### ABS Qualifying Exam (QE)

The ABS QE is offered to surgeons after completing their residency training, and must be passed in order to obtain initial certification to practice surgery. The multiple-choice exam tests a surgeon's knowledge of general surgical principles and their clinical application.

#### ABS Certifying Exam (CE)

After successfully completing the QE, a surgeon must pass the ABS CE to complete the certification process. The CE is an oral exam that tests a candidate's surgical judgment, clinical reasoning skills and problem-solving ability.
