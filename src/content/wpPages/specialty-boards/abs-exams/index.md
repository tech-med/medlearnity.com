## Scoring well on the ABSITE has a major impact on resident promotion. Moreover, failing to score within the 50th percentile or better will warrant academic probation or remediation.

## ABS In-Training Examination (ABSITE) Overview

### What Is The ABSITE?

The American Board of Surgery (ABS) certifies physicians in general surgery and surgical sub-specialties. The **ABS In-Training Exam (ABSITE)** is offered annually to residents in general surgery, and is administered using each program's own computer facilities. The ABSITE evaluates a **resident's knowledge and management of clinical problems related to surgical procedures**. It is a **5-hour computer-based exam**, which consists of approximately **250 multiple-choice questions**. There are no scheduled breaks during the exam, and examinees may return to past questions during the exam.

### What Content Does The ABSITE Cover?

The content of the ABSITE aligns with the **SCORE Curriculum Outline** for General Surgery. Content categories are broadly divided into **vascular surgery, abdominal, and alimentary tract**. General medical knowledge is also tested, including **anesthesia, biostatistics, fluids, geriatric surgery, immunology, minimally invasive surgery, oncology, pharmacology, preoperative evaluation and perioperative care, radiology, et\*\***hics, and more\*\*.

### How Important is The ABSITE?

Scoring well on the ABSITE is important. **Failure to score within the 50th percentile or better on the ABSITE will warrant academic probation or remediation**. Moreover, **ABSITE scores have a major impact on resident promotion**. Certification in general surgery is required for certification in pediatric surgery, surgical critical care, surgery of the hand, hospice and palliative medicine, and complex general surgical oncology.
