## The ABS CE is the last step in obtaining general surgery board certification. 

## ABS General Surgery Certifying Exam (CE) Overview

### What Is The ABS General Surgery Certifying Exam?

The American Board of Surgery (ABS) certifies physicians in general surgery and surgical sub-specialties. After successfully completing the [**ABS General Surgery Qualifying Exam**](https://www.medlearnity.com/abs-qualifying-certifying/) **(QE)**, a surgeon must pass the **oral ABS General Surgery Certifying Exam (CE)** to complete the certification process.

### How Is The ABS Certifying Exam Administered?

The CE is the last exam toward board certification in general surgery. It is an **oral exam** consisting of **three consecutive 30-minute sessions**, each conducted by a team of two examiners. **Four cases will be presented to the candidate during each 30-minute session**. The cases presented consist of problems seen in general surgery practice.

### What Does The ABS Certifying Exam Cover?

The purpose of the CE is to test a candidate's surgical judgment, clinical reasoning skills and problem-solving ability. All candidates are questioned across similar subject areas representing the breadth of general surgery, including: **Alimentary Tract (including Bariatric Surgery), Abdomen, Breast, Skin and Soft Tissue, Endocrine System, Solid Organ Transplantation, Pediatric Surgery, Surgical Critical Care, Surgical Oncology (including Head and Neck Surgery), Trauma and Emergency Surgery, Vascular Surgery**. The content of the CE generally aligns with the SCORE Curriculum Outline, but there is variation.
