## ABS Exams (ABSITE, Qualifying & Certifying Exams) Overview

The American Board of Surgery (ABS) certifies physicians in general surgery and surgical sub-specialties. The [**ABS In-Training Exam**](https://www.medlearnity.com/abs-exams/) **(ABSITE)** is offered annually to residents in general surgery, and has a significant impact on resident promotion. The ABSITE is designed to test the gains that residents have achieved in their knowledge of medical science and management of clinical problems related to surgical procedures.

The [**ABS General Surgery Qualifying Exam**](https://www.medlearnity.com/abs-qualifying-certifying/) **(QE)** is offered to surgeons after completing their residency training, and must be passed in order to obtain initial certification to practice surgery. After successfully completing the QE, a surgeon must pass the **oral** [**ABS General Surgery Certifying Exam**](https://www.medlearnity.com/abs-certifying-exam/) **(CE)** to complete the certification process.

## Internal Medicine Board Certification Exam (ABIM)

The American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) certifies physicians in internal medicine and internal medicine sub-specialties. [The Internal Medicine Board Certification Exam](https://www.medlearnity.com/internal-medicine-boards/) (the "ABIM") is required for certification in internal medicine, and to obtain privileges at most hospitals. The ABIM requires an immense depth of knowledge, and tests an examinee's ability to make appropriate diagnostic and management decisions for common as well as rare clinical problems for which patients may consult a certified internist.

## Family Medicine Board Certification Exam (ABFM)

The American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) certifies physicians in family medicine. [The Family Medicine Board Certification Exam](https://www.medlearnity.com/family-medicine-certification-exam-abfm/) (the "ABFM") is required for initial and ongoing certification in family medicine. Each time a board-certified family medicine practitioner successfully completes the ABFM, it resets his or her 10-year examination requirement.
