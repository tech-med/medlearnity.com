# Meet Nader Mohamed

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_I am a seasoned medical and anatomy tutor with a rich history of guiding students through intricate medical subjects. My journey as a medical tutor began, when I tutored over 50 underclassmen, steering them seamlessly through challenging medical concepts in preparation for their Step 1 and 2 exams and upcoming clinical rotations. By employing interactive PowerPoints, I was not only able to reinforce fundamental concepts but also introduce quizzes to promote active learning. The tangible improvement in my students' scores is a testament to the efficacy of this teaching strategy._
