# Meet Victoria Lord

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_"It has been incredibly rewarding to watch my students grow in their knowledge and confidence in test-taking skills during my years of teaching and tutoring. Medical examinations can be especially challenging given the many demands on students' time, so I strive to help students develop efficient study plans and increase their mastery in breaking down questions. I love learning each student's individual learning style and adapting study plans to fit their unique strengths and goals. I look forward to the chance to work with you!"_
