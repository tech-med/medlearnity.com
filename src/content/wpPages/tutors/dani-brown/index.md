# Meet Dani Brown

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_I love tutoring to help students build their clinical reasoning and test-taking skills! It is so rewarding to watch students develop confidence in their own abilities. Medical school exams are challenging and time-consuming, so I aim to focus on high-yield topics and help students develop efficient study plans._ Â
