# Meet Pranav Rekapalli

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_Tutoring is most rewarding for me when I'm able to adapt my teaching to what each student personally needs and help them grow in the ways that they hope to. In my tutoring, I strive to work with my students to achieve their own goals instead of teaching toward an exam, in a process that hopefully helps the both of us grow long after the exams are over._
