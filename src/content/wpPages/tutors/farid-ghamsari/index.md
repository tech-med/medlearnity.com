# Meet Farid Ghamsari

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_"I think there's few among us who go into medicine who don't love to share our knowledge with others. I personally realized I loved teaching in college as a Biology TA. I find it very rewarding to help others understand a difficult concept, even more so when I know I am helping them through some of the most stressful exams of their life like the STEP exams. I'm excited to help you feel ready and prepared to conquer the challenges ahead!"_
