# Meet Keith Cordner

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_Tutoring has been an incredibly rewarding opportunity for me. It grants perspective, helps me stay fresh on more obscure content, and crystalizes my own understanding of high yield topics by educating others. I strongly believe in using time effectively, focusing on quality over quantity. Yes, you can study 70 hours a week for marginal improvement on scores, but I prioritize high yield resources and mapping out exactly how my time needs to be allocated. Balancing medical success with a healthy personal life is critical to long term success, and I want to help you match into your dream program without alienating all of your friends and family._
