# Meet Sylvia Rhodes

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_"It has always been incredibly rewarding for me to mentor and tutor. Preparing for medical exams and admissions can be highly stressful, and I always strive to use my past experiences to make this process easier for my mentees while guiding them to their desired destinations. Along the way, I always enjoy the personal relationships I form with my tutees, while I watch them learn, improve, and succeed in achieving their goals. Additionally, I am always learning from my students and the process of teaching itself."_
