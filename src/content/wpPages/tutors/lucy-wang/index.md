# Meet Lucy Wang

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_Having previously tutored students across a wide range of subjects from organic chemistry to Roman poetry, I have a long-standing interest in teaching students difficult concepts. I strive to not only help students bridge their knowledge gaps, but also develop a systematic yet flexible approach to problem-solving. One of my most rewarding experiences is seeing students grow as strategic test-takers. I am excited to help each student find their individualized approach to tackling each problem with confidence._
