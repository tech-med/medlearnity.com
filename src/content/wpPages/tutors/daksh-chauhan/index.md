# Meet DakshÂ **Chauhan**

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_Having tutored for nearly 5 years, I have developed a student-centered style to teaching wherein I like to see the students perform as they would naturally first, identify areas of weakness, and then devise plans to target individual growth zones. I find it most rewarding when my students growth in each zone and gain further insight in their own thought-processes, growing further than ever._
