# Meet Matthew Augustine

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_"While the majority of radiology residencies nationwide adequately prepare their trainees to go out and be competent clinical radiologists, the CORE exam can be a challenging barrier to many. Gamesmanship and a specific knowledge base (which may or may not reflect daily practice) is necessary to ace the CORE. I hope that my personal experience preparing for the CORE as well as knowledge of hot topics and "boards relevant trivia" can help others to be successful on this stressful and challenging test."_
