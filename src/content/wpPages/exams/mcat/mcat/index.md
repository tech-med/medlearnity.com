## Your MCAT score is one of the most important parts of your medical school application. It plays a large factor in determining which medical schools you are accepted to, and the scholarships they offer you.

### MCAT Overview

#### How Is The MCAT Administered?

The MCAT is a standardized test required for admission to most medical schools. It is a computer-based, **7.5 hour exam** that tests your knowledge in the physical and biological sciences, as well as your verbal reasoning skills and writing ability. **Your MCAT score is one of the most important parts of your medical school application.**

#### What Content Does The MCAT Cover?

**The MCAT tests students on four main sections**: 1) Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems, 2) Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems, 3) Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior, and 4) Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (CARS). **The MCAT is used by admissions officers as an indicator of your success in medical school, and each of these four main sections tests students on skills and knowledge that admissions officers believe are important for an aspiring doctor to have.**

#### How is The MCAT Scored?

Each of the four sections on the exam is scored using a **118 to 132 range**. You will receive a score for each section, plus a total score (each section's score added up) -- which is your MCAT score. Total MCAT scores range between **472 and 528**. The average MCAT score is 500, and the national average for students accepted into U.S. medical schools is between 510-511, with an average GPA of 3.71.

#### How Important Is The MCAT?

Your MCAT score is one of the most important factors in your medical school application. It determines **what medical schools you receive acceptance letters from, and how many acceptance letters you receive. A really strong MCAT score can open doors to prestigious medical school acceptances, scholarship opportunities, and more**. The MCAT is extremely important, and it is **also within your control**. Make sure that you are using your study time optimally, and utilizing the best study strategies so that you can achieve your highest score potential on test day.

## **MCAT Tutoring Reviews From Real Students**

#### Their assistance is worth every penny and I plan to use them in the future.

I could not have had a better experience working with Akshay and his team. They go above and beyond to help you achieve your goal of becoming a physician and prepare you to succeed. They helped me prepare for the MCAT by creating a study plan, keeping me accountable and explaining difficult topics. Their assistance is worth every penny and I plan to use them in the future for USMLE tutoring. I could not recommend the use of their services more.

#### By the end of medical school, I had 38 interview invitations from Internal Medicine programs throughout the country, the highest number of interview invitations for my medical school class.

Throughout medical school, my ambitions had always been high but my test taking skills, not always the best. Working with Akshay provided a transformative experience. I had my first session with him while preparing for Step 1, and I have never looked back. Akshay offers a very structured, detailed, and personalized study plan that helped improve my fund of knowledge on a daily basis. During our one on one study sessions, he would be sure to break down complex physiological concepts and focus on subject areas that needed improvement. We would work through test taking strategies that were practical and quickly helped turn around my practice test scores. Thanks to Akshay, my Step 1 Score opened the door to a world of opportunities. To continue this pattern of success, I returned to Akshay for both Step 2 CK and CS. The results of Akshay's training were remarkable. After undergrad, I had only 2 medical school interviews, primarily because of poor test taking. By the end of medical school, I had 38 interview invitations from Internal Medicine programs throughout the country, the highest number of interview invitations for my medical school class. Fortunately, I matched into my number 1 residency program at Johns Hopkins. I would recommend Akshay to anyone looking for a tried and tested strategy for success on the USMLE. More importantly, I thank him for giving me the tools to become a better doctor.
