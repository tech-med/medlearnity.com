## The NBME Shelf Exams, administered after clerkship rotations during your third year, test your subject-specific knowledge after each rotation and serve as the foundation for Step 2 CK prep.

### NBME Shelf Exam Overview

#### What Are The Shelf Exams?

The NBME Subject Examinations are commonly referred to as the NBME Shelf Exams, or "Shelf Exams." The Shelf Exams are a series of subject-specific standardized tests that are administered after the completion of certain clerkship rotations during the third year of medical school. 

#### How Are The Shelf Exams Administered?

Each Shelf Exam is composed of **110 multiple-choice questions**, and aims to assess your mastery of the subject-specific material of each clerkship.

#### How Important Are The Shelf Exams?

Performing well on the Shelf Exams is extremely important, as it sets the tone for establishing your **confidence in clinical and medical knowledge**, and serves as a critical **foundation for material that is covered in** [**Step 2 CK**](https://www.medlearnity.com/step-2ck-usmle/). Balancing clinical work during your rotations and studying for the Shelf Exams can be overwhelming, but utilizing efficient study methods like **spaced repetition with active recall**, will go a long way. It is also important to make sure that you are **taking practice tests and thoroughly reviewing practice questions** -- and learning from each right and wrong answer choice.

## **Real Medical Student Reviews**

#### Sadjad is EXCEPTIONAL as both a person and a teacher.

I have worked with multiple tutors from med Learnity for step 1 & the medicine shelf. I likely would not have made it this far without them. Every tutor I have worked with has been extremely knowledgable & has an amazing understanding of all the concepts of medicine. I have never had people answer my questions so well until I started working with med Learnity. Additionally, one of my biggest challenges is test anxiety and timing. Each of my tutors went out their way to keep adjusting our preparation techniques until I was able to succeed. They would even talk to me about struggles in life and how to overcome them to maintain focus on school. Lastly, med school is long and can cause burn out. The team wants you to succeed and will keep you accountable. They reignited my passion for medicine and kept me on track. I highly highly highly recommend med Learnity if you are struggling passing step 1 or a shelf. If you put in the work with them, you will succeed (if I can do it, trust me anyone can!!). The most recent tutor I had was Sadjad who is EXCEPTIONAL as both a person and a teacher. While med Learnity is expensive, it is an investment in your future and they will get you where you want to be.

#### For anyone who needs that extra guidance and help for step 1 and step 2

There are not enough words to express my gratitude for Akshay and his team. I used tutors through medlearnity for step 1 and step 2. I worked with Henry throughout most of second year tutoring for step 1. My institution did a poor job preparing for step 1, but with Henry's help and guidance I was able to pass step 1. Throughout 3rd year I tutoring with Radhika for my shelf exam. SHE IS AN AMAZING TUTOR! After a few lesson she seemed to understand my learning style and catering to it. Right before my internal medicine shelf, I got a concussion. She worked around my schedule and was so supportive. Seriously without her, I wouldn't have been able to get through my concussion on top of a worldwide pandemic. Leading up to step 2, I worked with Isao along with Radhika. They started to help me with strategy more than content. Leading up towards test day I felt more confident that I ever had with the help of this team. Akshay is an amazing educator who truly cares about his students! I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who needs that extra guidance and help for step 1 and step 2.
