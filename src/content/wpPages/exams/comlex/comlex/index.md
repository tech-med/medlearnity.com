#### I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who wants help learning invaluable skills for taking medical examinations

I used Medlearnity over the course of six months to help prepare me for Step 1. In the past I have struggled with standardized tests and knew I would need help to achieve the competitive score I desired. Dr. Goel and Dustin were both incredible mentors and teachers! Dustin explained difficult concepts clearly and thoroughly during every session. He was always available to answer questions in-between sessions and helped me identify weaknesses in my knowledge and test-taking abilities. During my dedicated study period, Dr. Goel called me often to check on my progress, and provided me with invaluable tips and tricks to reduce my test anxiety. I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who wants help learning invaluable skills for taking medical examinations

#### I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them.

I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them. The tutoring really helped me through the daunting task of preparing for the exam, and preparing for future standardized testing as well. I was assigned a tutor for the ACM -type questions and biostats, as well as a second tutor for CCS. I also received significant, and much needed coaching from Dr. Gohel, so I actually had a team of 3 doctors helping me prep. An amazing team, sure to get even the busiest scalpel back to razor sharpness
