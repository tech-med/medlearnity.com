## COMLEX Level 3 is the final hurdle in the COMLEX exam series, and is often the most underestimated by aspiring doctors. Don't let your guard down just yet.

## COMLEX Level 3 Overview

### How is COMLEX Level 3 Administered?

Level 3 is typically taken during the first year of residency. It is a **two-day** computer-based exam, consisting of four computer-based test sessions of 3 1/2 hours each, taken over two days (two sessions per day). The two days of testing are administered within a 14-day window. The exam contains 420 questions in the multiple-choice question (MCQ) format and 26 clinical decision-making (CDM) cases that include two to four questions each. MCQs have a single-best answer format, and CDM questions are either extended multiple-choice or short answer.

### What Content Does COMLEX Level 3 Cover?

Level 3 assesses competency required of generalist physicians to deliver safe and effective osteopathic medical care and promote health in unsupervised clinical settings. Level 3 tests **emergency medicine, family medicine, preventive medicine and health promotion, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, osteopathic principles and practice, pediatrics, psychiatry and surgery**.

### How Important is Level 3 of the COMLEX?

Level 3 is the final examination in the COMLEX series that **an aspiring doctor must pass to earn a license to practice osteopathic medicine in the United States without supervision.** 

### How is COMLEX Level 3 Scored?

The minimum passing score for Level 3 is 350, and the national average is approximately 550, with a standard deviation of about 125. Level 3 is the COMLEX exam that is most often underestimated by aspiring doctors. **Students who have** [**excelled on Level 1**](https://www.medlearnity.com/comlex-1/) **and** [**Level 2-CE**](https://www.medlearnity.com/level-2-ce-and-pe/) **may have challenges with Level 3, given their busy residency schedule and distance from the clinical concepts tested on Level 3.**
