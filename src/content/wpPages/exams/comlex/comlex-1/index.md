## **Your COMLEX Level 1 score plays a large factor in determining which medical specialties you can pursue and what residency program you match into.**

## COMLEX Level 1 Overview

### What Content Does COMLEX Level 1 Cover?

Level 1 is typically taken after completing the second year of medical school. The exam is a **problem and symptom-based assessment** that requires knowledge in foundational biomedical sciences and medicine to solve clinical problems and provide osteopathic medical care to patients. **Level 1 tests anatomy, behavioral science, biochemistry, genetics, immunology, microbiology, osteopathic principles and practice, pathology, pharmacology, physiology, and public health.** 

### How is COMLEX Level 1 Administered?

It is a one-day exam, 8 hours, administered in two 4-hour computer-based testing sessions. The 4-hour testing sessions are separated by a 40-minute break. The exam will have 400 multiple-choice test questions related to diverse clinical and patient presentations and defined competency domains for osteopathic medicine. There will also be some questions involving audio-visual components.

### How Important is Level 1 of the COMLEX?

Level 1 is an extremely important exam, as **it determines which medical specialties you can pursue and what** [**residency program**](https://www.medlearnity.com/residency-admissions/) **you match into**.

### How is COMLEX Level 1 Scored?

**A passing score on Level 1 is 400, and the national average is approximately 500-540**, with a standard deviation of about 85. Many residency programs use a "cutoff" score for Level 1, below which applicants are not likely to be considered. Applicants with a significantly higher Level 2 score may still receive further consideration. **Competitive specialties such as radiology and dermatology require a score of at least 630+** to be realistically considered.

### **Real Student Reviews**

#### I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who wants help learning invaluable skills for taking medical examinations

I used Medlearnity over the course of six months to help prepare me for Step 1. In the past I have struggled with standardized tests and knew I would need help to achieve the competitive score I desired. Dr. Goel and Dustin were both incredible mentors and teachers! Dustin explained difficult concepts clearly and thoroughly during every session. He was always available to answer questions in-between sessions and helped me identify weaknesses in my knowledge and test-taking abilities. During my dedicated study period, Dr. Goel called me often to check on my progress, and provided me with invaluable tips and tricks to reduce my test anxiety. I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who wants help learning invaluable skills for taking medical examinations
