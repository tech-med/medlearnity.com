## Real USMLE Student Testimonials

#### I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who wants help learning invaluable skills for taking medical examinations!

I used Medlearnity over the course of six months to help prepare me for Step 1. In the past I have struggled with standardized tests and knew I would need help to achieve the competitive score I desired. Dr. Goel and Dustin were both incredible mentors and teachers! Dustin explained difficult concepts clearly and thoroughly during every session. He was always available to answer questions in-between sessions and helped me identify weaknesses in my knowledge and test-taking abilities. During my dedicated study period, Dr. Goel called me often to check on my progress, and provided me with invaluable tips and tricks to reduce my test anxiety. I would highly recommend Medlearnity to anyone who wants help learning invaluable skills for taking medical examinations!

#### I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them.

I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them. The tutoring really helped me through the daunting task of preparing for the exam, and preparing for future standardized testing as well. I was assigned a tutor for the ACM -type questions and biostats, as well as a second tutor for CCS. I also received significant, and much needed coaching from Dr. Gohel, so I actually had a team of 3 doctors helping me prep. An amazing team, sure to get even the busiest scalpel back to razor sharpness!

#### With Akshay's help and support, I was able to successfully pass Step 2 CK by a good margin and ended up matching into a University residency program.

When I failed the USMLE Step 2 CK, I was concerned that I had reached my peak in knowledge retention. Leading up to the exam, I had read from multiple sources and completed over 2000 practice questions. Still, I felt unprepared to make a second attempt and was afraid I would never pass the exam. As a last effort, I decided to get a tutor.

Starting from my very first session with Akshay, I knew that he was the right tutor for me--one who would be able to guide me through what I had yet to learn. He dissected the way I had been approaching questions, refined my study schedule, and gave me tips on how to become more efficient. He taught me methods that helped drastically increase my ability to retain information. He also streamlined my studying so that I wasted less time on the unimportant things. Besides all that, Akshay was a great source of motivation and confidence.

With Akshay's help and support, I was able to successfully pass Step 2 CK by a good margin and ended up matching into a University residency program. I now apply his methods to all of my learning and never hesitate to recommend him to people I know.
