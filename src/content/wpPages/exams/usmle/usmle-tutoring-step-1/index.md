## Passing the USMLE Step 1 in 2025 is extremely important, as it plays a large role in determining which medical specialties you can pursue & what residency program you match into.

## USMLE Step 1 Exam Details & Overview

### What Content Does USMLE Step 1 Cover?

Step 1 is typically taken in the second or third year of medical school. The exam assesses your ability to apply knowledge of the foundational sciences to the practice of medicine. **Step 1 covers pathology, physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry, microbiology, immunology, anatomy, cell biology, behavioral sciences and genetics**.

### How is USMLE Step 1 Administered?

It is a one-day exam administered in one 8-hour testing session. The exam is divided into seven 60-minute blocks, with each block having a maximum of 40 questions. The total number of items on the overall exam will not exceed 280.

### How Important is Step 1 of the USMLE?

**Step 1 is one of the most important exams you will take in your medical career,** as it determines which medical specialties you can pursue and what residency program you match into.

### How is USMLE Step 1 Scored?

As of 2022, the USMLE is graded in a [pass or fail format](https://www.medlearnity.com/usmle-step-1-pass-fail/). Students must open every block on their exam to have their exam marked as complete and receive scoring. Correct answers must account for at least 60% of the questions to receive a passing score. 

Now that the Step 1 exam has a pass or fail result, students rely on their Step 2 results and other factors to stand out on their residency applications. Impressive factors include letters of recommendation, clerkship grades, publications, research projects and extracurricular activities like volunteering or holding leadership positions in clubs.
