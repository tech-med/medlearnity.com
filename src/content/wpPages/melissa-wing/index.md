# Meet Melissa Wing

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_"My love of tutoring began in high school when a fellow classmate needed help in Italian class and has continued to grow over 10 years later. Medical school is hard enough without having to spend hundreds of hours preparing for board exams, interviews, and applications in addition to learning key clinical skills in preparation for residency. I find great joy in working with my students' unique learning styles to create an individual approach that allows them to gain confidence and succeed in all aspects of medical school!"_
