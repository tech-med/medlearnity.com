# Failed Step 1?

## Conquer Step 1 of the USMLE & get into your first-choice residency

The most significant challenge of your medical career can become your greatest opportunity to stand out.

## Do any of these sound like you?

- You had one or more failed attempts at passing Step 1 of the USMLE.
- You’ve taken practice tests but you're still worried you're going to fail step 1.
- You’ve been studying for Step 1 but you want to take your study plan to the next level so you can match into a highly competitive residency program.
- You’re spending hours preparing for the USMLE Step 1, but you’ve hit a score plateau and you’re not improving any further.
- You experience test anxiety on high-stakes exams, and you want to be able to tackle the USMLE Step 1 with confidence.
- You’re committed to your medical career, and you’re ready to do whatever it takes to succeed.

## If any of the above statements sound like you, we want you to know that you’re not alone!

Thousands of med students take the USMLE every year. Many of them struggle to pass and end up failing Step 1. The USMLE is widely considered to be the most difficult set of exams in the country. The overwhelming responsibilities of med school and intern year can make it difficult to find the time to study, and using the wrong study strategies can make your limited study time less effective.

## Your performance on the USMLE is one of the most important factors in determining which residency program you match with.

Data from the NRMP (the National Residency Matching Program, the program that administers the Match) indicate that residency directors rank applicant’s scores on USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK among the most important factors in determining who gets invited for an interview. Your performance on these exams could determine whether you even get a chance to interview at the program of your choice.

Residency directors give a lot of weight to USMLE scores, because they’re standardized and easily comparable across different med schools. This gives them a unique weight in your residency application.If you’re planning to apply for a fellowship after your residency, then your Step 3 scores will also become important in your application. At the same time, passing Step 1 continues to be important even into fellowship. This is why it’s crucial to achieve the best possible scores on these exams; a less-than-stellar performance on Step 1 or Step 2 CK could put limits on your career choices years later.Passing step 1 is crucial to your future in medicine. Your choice of specialty, residency location, and other program specifics depends heavily on your USMLE scores.

## The good news is that passing Step 1 largely under your control.

**You can pass Step 1.**

## Reviews From Students Who Previously Failed Step 1

Akshay is a very patient tutor who focuses on strengthening an individual's weaknesses to promote a successful outcome, whether their weaknesses be timing, fund of knowledge, poor sleeping habits, level of testing anxiety or a combination of the above. I personally struggled with the Step 1 Medical exam and sought out help. I was fortunate enough to work with Akshay who focused on me as a whole rather than just the fund of knowledge. **After just a few months of online tutoring services with Akshay, I successfully passed Step 1 with significant improvement compared to my prior failed attempts**. I was able to use the tools and skills learned during our sessions to successfully complete the remaining Medical Step exams allowing me to continue on the path of pursuing my goal of being a Pediatrician. After my success, I referred my friend to work with him and she had similar success.

**Nicole S.****Step 1 student**

**I initially worked with Akshay a few years ago after I had failed Step 1.** We worked together via video chat which worked out great for both of our busy schedules and allowed Akshay to utilize technology to enhance my learning experience. Each session, Akshay used technology creatively to track my progress, to address my personal weaknesses and then to build skills and techniques to target my individual needs. Akshay is compassionate and patient with his students; he greatly improved my confidence as a test taker and helped me strengthen my knowledge base. **I am happy to report that not only did I pass Step 1 with a much stronger score, but, even after we stopped working together, I continued to use his strategies as I prepared for subsequent tests and recently aced my specialty boards**. I've worked with various tutors throughout my life and I would definitely say that Akshay stands out as unique. Akshay is clearly passionate about teaching and I would recommend him highly to anyone who is struggling or just looking to improve their score or medical knowledge.
