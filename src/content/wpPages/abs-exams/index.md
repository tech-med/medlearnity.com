### What Is The ABSITE?

The American Board of Surgery (ABS) certifies physicians in general surgery and surgical sub-specialties. The **ABS In-Training Exam (ABSITE)** is offered annually to residents in general surgery, and is administered using each program's own computer facilities. The ABSITE evaluates a **resident's knowledge and management of clinical problems related to surgical procedures**. It is a **5-hour computer-based exam**, which consists of approximately **250 multiple-choice questions**. There are no scheduled breaks during the exam, and examinees may return to past questions during the exam.

### What Content Does The ABSITE Cover?

The content of the ABSITE aligns with the **SCORE Curriculum Outline** for General Surgery. Content categories are broadly divided into **vascular surgery, abdominal, and alimentary tract**. General medical knowledge is also tested, including **anesthesia, biostatistics, fluids, geriatric surgery, immunology, minimally invasive surgery, oncology, pharmacology, preoperative evaluation and perioperative care, radiology, et****hics, and more**.

### How Important is The ABSITE?

Scoring well on the ABSITE is important. **Failure to score within the 50th percentile or better on the ABSITE will warrant academic probation or remediation**. Moreover, **ABSITE scores have a major impact on resident promotion**. Certification in general surgery is required for certification in pediatric surgery, surgical critical care, surgery of the hand, hospice and palliative medicine, and complex general surgical oncology.

## Verified Reviews From ABSITE Students

#### Great Experience!

I was constantly being taught high-yield information. Anthony kept reinforcing the information I was not grasping right away, and he sensed that. He provided grafts, charts, and other methods of learning to solidify the important concepts. I was given recordings of our sessions, and I will have so much material to use from this point on (I'm a PGY1, and this is an incredible foundation).

#### Anthony’s experience in surgery... helped me hone in on my strengths

In the words of Serena Williams and Billie-Jean King, “Pressure is a privilege.” I agree completely, but when it comes to the ABSITE, the privilege of being a surgical resident can feel a bit more pressure-like. Thank you to Anthony and the Medlearnity Team for providing professional, reliable assistance in a time of need. Standardized tests never come easy to me, and of course, I ended up choosing a career that is chock full of standardized testing. The ABSITE is a tough exam, is comprehensive in the topics covered, and is proctored in the midst of working an intense surgical resident schedule. Anthony’s experience in surgery, in test-taking, and test- creating helped me hone in on my strengths, hone in even more importantly on my gaps in knowledge, and truly understand how to focus my study efforts. He provided real time feedback about my thought process in regards to specific practice questions. He provided knowledge about the nuances in a question stem and the respective answer choices to help me successfully answer. He helped me understand the highest yield concepts that would help me succeed on exam day. He provided engaging, effective sessions that accommodated my scheduled, no matter what time of day. I felt supported during the entire time I was working with Anthony and the Medlearnity Team, and I can’t thank everyone enough for the help.

This is the first year I have taken the exam where I felt like I knew more of the answers than not, and it proved to be a much less stressful testing experience overall. Knowledge is power, and Anthony definitely helped me increase my knowledge exponentially, not only to succeed on the ABSITE, but as a surgeon as well.

Thank you for everything!

VH, PGY-3, General Surgery

Anthony has done an amazing job preparing me for my ABSITE exam. He was always punctual and encouraging for all of my 20hours of private lessons! He really catered to my weaknesses and helped really elaborate on concepts to help further my knowledge. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for tutoring. I'm extremely grateful to him and the whole Medlearnity team for continuously checking up on my progress.
