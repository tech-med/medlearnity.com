## Our medical school admissions package is comprehensive. We provide invaluable guidance on everything you need to know, from your application and personal statement to interviewing.

### Application Editing

The AMCAS, AACOMAS, TMDSAS, and ERAS application is the first thing that the admissions committee will see. It should **highlight your accomplishments and experiences effectively**.

### Personal Statement Editing

Your personal statement is often the **deciding factor in getting an interview**. Craft it to connect with and move your audience. Make it compelling, and show why you will make a unique contribution to the field of medicine.

### Interview Preparation

An interview is your opportunity to make a first impression -- so make it count! Our admissions consultants will **mock interview** you, and **walk you through every step** so you are fully prepared.

### Secondary Essay Editing

The secondary essay is your chance to show the committee why you're interested in their school. An essay that shows a personalized interest in the school **can increase your chances for admission**.
