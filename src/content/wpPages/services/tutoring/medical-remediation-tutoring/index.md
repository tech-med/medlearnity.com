USMLE Step 1 and 2 CK Student

"Throughout medical school, my ambitions had always been high but my test taking skills, not always the best. Working with Akshay provided a transformative experience. I had my first session with him while preparing for Step 1, and I have never looked back. Akshay offers a very structured, detailed, and personalized study plan that helped improve my fund of knowledge on a daily basis. During our one on one study sessions, he would be sure to break down complex physiological concepts and focus on subject areas that needed improvement. We would work through test taking strategies that were practical and quickly helped turn around my practice test scores. Thanks to Akshay, my Step 1 Score opened the door to a world of opportunities. To continue this pattern of success, I returned to Akshay for both Step 2 CK and CS. The results of Akshay's training were remarkable. After undergrad, I had only 2 medical school interviews, primarily because of poor test taking. By the end of medical school, I had 38 interview invitations from Internal Medicine programs throughout the country, the highest number of interview invitations for my medical school class. Fortunately, I matched into my number 1 residency program at Johns Hopkins. I would recommend Akshay to anyone looking for a tried and tested strategy for success on the USMLE. More importantly, I thank him for giving me the tools to become a better doctor."
