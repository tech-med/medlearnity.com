## A strong score on COMLEX Level 2-CE bolsters your residency application, especially if your COMLEX Level 1 score wasn't ideal. Even if you did do well on Level 1, a strong performance on Level 2-CE demonstrates consistency and clinical excellence.

## COMLEX Level 2-CE and Level 2-PE Overview

COMLEX Level 2 is taken during the third or fourth year of medical school. It consists of two parts, **Level 2-CE**, Cognitive Evaluation and **Level 2-PE**, Performance Evaluation. 

### What Content Does COMLEX Level 2-PE Cover?

**Level 2-PE** is a one-day, 7-hour clinical skills exam that utilizes standardized patients (actors) to simulate real-life patient encounters and test your clinical skills. You will have 12 patient encounters, each 14 minutes in duration. Following each encounter, candidates have 9 minutes to type a SOAP note. Level 2-PE is graded on a pass/fail basis. 

### What Content Does COMLEX Level 2-CE Cover?

Unlike Level 2-PE, **Level 2-CE is graded on a competitive numerical scale**. It is a multiple-choice, 8-hour exam, divided into two testing sessions of 4-hours each. Level 2-CE is a problem and symptoms-based exam that requires candidates to demonstrate knowledge of clinical concepts and medical decision-making. Level 2-CE **tests emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, osteopathic principles, pediatrics, psychiatry and surgery**. 

### How is COMLEX Level 2-CE Scored?

A passing score on Level 2-CE is 400, and the national average is approximately 540, with a standard deviation of about 100. Competitive specialties such as radiology and dermatology expect residency applicants to perform well on Level 2 CE. **A strong performance on Level 2-CE bolsters your residency application significantly**, making you a more competitive candidate for prestigious residency programs, **especially if your** **Level 1** **score wasn't ideal. Even if you did** [**score well on Level 1**](https://www.medlearnity.com/comlex-1/)**, a strong performance on Level 2-CE demonstrates consistency and clinical excellence.**

## **Real Medical Student Reviews**

#### Dr. Goel is an amazing tutor and he will bring out the very best in anyone with whom he works. His services will be a remarkable asset to any exam preparation plan and he has the experience and results that attest to this.

I am a US medical school graduate who has a very difficult time with standardized testing. So much so that initially, I did not pass the second part of the USMLE exam (STEP 2 CK.) I found out about Dr. Goel's tutoring through a friend who used him for her USMLE test preparation. During our initial meeting, I knew he was the perfect tutor for my needs. He was able to accurately assess my strengths and weakness based on our personal interaction rather than assume what I needed according to my previous score. This was essential to the services he rendered because he quickly determined that I had a wealth of knowledge suitable for this exam but my test-taking skills were the source of my issues.

Dr. Goel created a plan that accurately and efficiently addressed the weaknesses in my testing skills. His program included optimizing the use of Anki, which is an electronic note card program, a special strategy to approach the multiple choice questions on USMLE boards, and reviewing material from common board prep question banks. He also designed a pacing system to help me stay on track with timing for each question and he would select various topics for us to discuss the pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and treatment in order to ensure comprehensive understanding of key medical presentations even beyond the board exam.

Overall, Dr. Goel's support and interest in my immediate and long term goals were exemplary. With his strategic and specific approach, I was able to pass STEP 2 CK with a score that increased by more than 30 points. The results speak for themselves! Dr. Goel is an amazing tutor and he will bring out the very best in anyone with whom he works. His services will be a remarkable asset to any exam preparation plan and he has the experience and results that attest to this. I am truly grateful that I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Goel and I enthusiastically recommend him as an integral component to your medical exam study plan!
