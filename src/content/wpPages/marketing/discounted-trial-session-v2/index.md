## Discounted Session Overview

**Get a personalized, high-impact 60-minute session for just $39 — normally $199/hour.** Work 1-on-1  with a top-scoring physician tutor who will:

- **Assess your strengths and weaknesses**
- **Build a custom study strategy**
- **Teach high-yield, exam-relevant content**
- **Provide actionable feedback and a session recording**

No commitment. Just real results — fast.

**Act quickly** — discounted session availability is limited. Sessions usually schedule within 1–3 days. If we’re unable to schedule within three days, we’ll reach out to reschedule or issue a full refund.

### What to Expect

**For tutoring sessions:**

You’re welcome to email your tutor beforehand if there’s specific content you’d like to focus on. If not, they’ll lead with high-yield topics that matter most for your exam.

**For admissions consulting:**

Use your session to focus on strategy, interview prep, or personal statement feedback — whatever you need most at this stage of the process.
