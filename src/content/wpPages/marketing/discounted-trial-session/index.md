## Discounted Session Overview

The first 1-hour session at Medlearnity is _discounted_. Once you sign up, you'll receive an email or phone call from us shortly thereafter. We need this information to:

1. 1Understand your particular situation
2. 2Assess your needs
3. 3Pair you with the tutor that's a perfect fit for you

Depending on the time of year, scheduling the trial usually takes _one to three days_. If we cannot schedule this within three days, we'll contact you directly to schedule a time or refund your reservation.

### First Session Details

During this first session, your tutor or advisor will tailor the session based on your background.

**For tutoring sessions:** Feel free to email your tutor beforehand if there's specific content you want to cover or questions you'd like addressed. Otherwise, they will focus on high-yield topics crucial for your exam.

**For admissions consulting:** The session can be directed towards strategy development, interview preparation, or personal statement editing.
