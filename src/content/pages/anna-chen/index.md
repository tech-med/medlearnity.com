# Meet Anna Chen

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_There is nothing more fulfilling than turning anxiety into empowerment and confusion into confidence. That is why I strive to equip students with the study strategies, question approaches, knowledge base, and mindsets they need to tackle exams with confidence - and get the results to back it up. I take seriously my students' individual needs and areas of strength and weakness to ensure a tailored approach to test or admissions prep. Above all, my aim is for students to walk away from our sessions with tools under their belts that will benefit them long-term on the rest of their professional journey. Let's work toward your goals together!_
