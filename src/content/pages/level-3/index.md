## COMLEX Level 3 Overview

### How is COMLEX Level 3 Administered?

Level 3 is typically taken during the first year of residency. It is a **two-day** computer-based exam, consisting of four computer-based test sessions of 3 1/2 hours each, taken over two days (two sessions per day). The two days of testing are administered within a 14-day window. The exam contains 420 questions in the multiple-choice question (MCQ) format and 26 clinical decision-making (CDM) cases that include two to four questions each. MCQs have a single-best answer format, and CDM questions are either extended multiple-choice or short answer.

### What Content Does COMLEX Level 3 Cover?

Level 3 assesses competency required of generalist physicians to deliver safe and effective osteopathic medical care and promote health in unsupervised clinical settings. Level 3 tests **emergency medicine, family medicine, preventive medicine and health promotion, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, osteopathic principles and practice, pediatrics, psychiatry and surgery**.

### How Important is Level 3 of the COMLEX?

Level 3 is the final examination in the COMLEX series that **an aspiring doctor must pass to earn a license to practice osteopathic medicine in the United States without supervision.** 

### How is COMLEX Level 3 Scored?

The minimum passing score for Level 3 is 350, and the national average is approximately 550, with a standard deviation of about 125. Level 3 is the COMLEX exam that is most often underestimated by aspiring doctors. **Students who have** [**excelled on Level 1**](https://www.medlearnity.com/comlex-1/) **and** [**Level 2-CE**](https://www.medlearnity.com/level-2-ce-and-pe/) **may have challenges with Level 3, given their busy residency schedule and distance from the clinical concepts tested on Level 3.**

## **Real Medical Student Reviews**

#### Anthony’s experience in surgery... helped me hone in on my strengths

In the words of Serena Williams and Billie-Jean King, “Pressure is a privilege.” I agree completely, but when it comes to the ABSITE, the privilege of being a surgical resident can feel a bit more pressure-like. Thank you to Anthony and the Medlearnity Team for providing professional, reliable assistance in a time of need. Standardized tests never come easy to me, and of course, I ended up choosing a career that is chock full of standardized testing. The ABSITE is a tough exam, is comprehensive in the topics covered, and is proctored in the midst of working an intense surgical resident schedule. Anthony’s experience in surgery, in test-taking, and test- creating helped me hone in on my strengths, hone in even more importantly on my gaps in knowledge, and truly understand how to focus my study efforts. He provided real time feedback about my thought process in regards to specific practice questions. He provided knowledge about the nuances in a question stem and the respective answer choices to help me successfully answer. He helped me understand the highest yield concepts that would help me succeed on exam day. He provided engaging, effective sessions that accommodated my scheduled, no matter what time of day. I felt supported during the entire time I was working with Anthony and the Medlearnity Team, and I can’t thank everyone enough for the help.

This is the first year I have taken the exam where I felt like I knew more of the answers than not, and it proved to be a much less stressful testing experience overall. Knowledge is power, and Anthony definitely helped me increase my knowledge exponentially, not only to succeed on the ABSITE, but as a surgeon as well.

Thank you for everything!

VH, PGY-3, General Surgery

#### I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them.

I used Medlearnity to prep for USMLE Step 3, and I can't say enough great things about them. The tutoring really helped me through the daunting task of preparing for the exam, and preparing for future standardized testing as well. I was assigned a tutor for the ACM -type questions and biostats, as well as a second tutor for CCS. I also received significant, and much needed coaching from Dr. Gohel, so I actually had a team of 3 doctors helping me prep. An amazing team, sure to get even the busiest scalpel back to razor sharpness!
