I was constantly being taught high-yield information. Anthony kept reinforcing the information I was not grasping right away, and he sensed that. He provided grafts, charts, and other methods of learning to solidify the important concepts. I was given recordings of our sessions, and I will have so much material to use from this point on (I'm a PGY1, and this is an incredible foundation).

Anthony has done an amazing job preparing me for my ABSITE exam. He was always punctual and encouraging for all of my 20hours of private lessons! He really catered to my weaknesses and helped really elaborate on concepts to help further my knowledge. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for tutoring. I'm extremely grateful to him and the whole Medlearnity team for continuously checking up on my progress.

**Peter I.**

I had a great experience. Anthony was very knowledgeable and more than willing to go out of his way to help me succeed on ABIM. At the end of my tutoring I felt prepared going into my exam. Would definitely recommend Anthony and Medlearnity to anyone! [Reference Link](https://g.co/kgs/FQdYFy).

**Patrick Jones**

I took this course in preparation for the ABFM. Anthony was incredibly knowledgable regarding the test content itself as well as test taking strategies. He was able to provide guidance regarding test question prompts and rationalizing the "best option".

**CP**

Anthony is an amazing tutor. He explains things in a way that anyone can understand and has many tricks to remember the small details. I have never been a strong test taker, but with this tutoring, I nearly doubled my percentile on absite. Highly recommend!

# More reviews about Anthony

**"Blown away with how knowledgeable and patient and helpful Anthony was."**

I failed my written boards first try and was lost as to how to improve my odds for the second attempt. I googled “general surgery boards tutor” and MedLearnity came up. I gave it a shot with the sample session, and was immediately blown away with how knowledgeable and patient and helpful Anthony was. He has real world surgical experience, and more importantly he understands how board examiners are likely to ask questions. 

He makes sure you understand why you answer things right or wrong, and if you get something right he will ask you other ways that question could be asked. Having a schedule was also really helpful, and he provides a week by week schedule that you can take or leave. In addition he has these incredible study guides that compile lots and lots of factoids into digestible tables & lists. I easily got 5-10 questions just off one of his study guides.

Overall, I trusted Anthony and he really made all the difference in terms of my passing this second time. He is patient, knowledgeable, personable, and really invested in your success. I will absolutely be signing up to work with him for oral boards.

**“Anthony’s experience in surgery... helped me hone in on my strengths"**

In the words of Serena Williams and Billie-Jean King, “Pressure is a privilege.” I agree completely, but when it comes to the ABSITE, the privilege of being a surgical resident can feel a bit more pressure-like. Thank you to Anthony and the Medlearnity Team for providing professional, reliable assistance in a time of need. Standardized tests never come easy to me, and of course, I ended up choosing a career that is chock full of standardized testing. The ABSITE is a tough exam, is comprehensive in the topics covered, and is proctored in the midst of working an intense surgical resident schedule. Anthony’s experience in surgery, in test-taking, and test- creating helped me hone in on my strengths, hone in even more importantly on my gaps in knowledge, and truly understand how to focus my study efforts. He provided real time feedback about my thought process in regards to specific practice questions. He provided knowledge about the nuances in a question stem and the respective answer choices to help me successfully answer. He helped me understand the highest yield concepts that would help me succeed on exam day. He provided engaging, effective sessions that accommodated my scheduled, no matter what time of day. I felt supported during the entire time I was working with Anthony and the Medlearnity Team, and I can’t thank everyone enough for the help.This is the first year I have taken the exam where I felt like I knew more of the answers than not, and it proved to be a much less stressful testing experience overall. Knowledge is power, and Anthony definitely helped me increase my knowledge exponentially, not only to succeed on the ABSITE, but as a surgeon as well. Thank you for everything!
