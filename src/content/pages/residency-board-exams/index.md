The American Board of Surgery (ABS) certifies physicians in general surgery and surgical sub-specialties. The [**ABS In-Training Exam**](https://www.medlearnity.com/abs-exams/) **(ABSITE)** is offered annually to residents in general surgery, and has a significant impact on resident promotion. The ABSITE is designed to test the gains that residents have achieved in their knowledge of medical science and management of clinical problems related to surgical procedures.

The [**ABS General Surgery Qualifying Exam**](https://www.medlearnity.com/abs-qualifying-certifying/) **(QE)** is offered to surgeons after completing their residency training, and must be passed in order to obtain initial certification to practice surgery. After successfully completing the QE, a surgeon must pass the **oral** [**ABS General Surgery Certifying Exam**](https://www.medlearnity.com/abs-certifying-exam/) **(CE)** to complete the certification process.

The American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) certifies physicians in internal medicine and internal medicine sub-specialties. [The Internal Medicine Board Certification Exam](https://www.medlearnity.com/internal-medicine-boards/) (the "ABIM") is required for certification in internal medicine, and to obtain privileges at most hospitals. The ABIM requires an immense depth of knowledge, and tests an examinee's ability to make appropriate diagnostic and management decisions for common as well as rare clinical problems for which patients may consult a certified internist.

#### I am happy to report that not only did I pass Step 1 with a much stronger score, but, even after we stopped working together, I continued to use his strategies as I prepared for subsequent tests and recently aced my specialty boards.

I initially worked with Akshay a few years ago after I had failed Step 1. We worked together via video chat which worked out great for both of our busy schedules and allowed Akshay to utilize technology to enhance my learning experience. Each session, Akshay used technology creatively to track my progress, to address my personal weaknesses and then to build skills and techniques to target my individual needs. Akshay is compassionate and patient with his students; he greatly improved my confidence as a test taker and helped me strengthen my knowledge base. I am happy to report that not only did I pass Step 1 with a much stronger score, but, even after we stopped working together, I continued to use his strategies as I prepared for subsequent tests and recently aced my specialty boards. I've worked with various tutors throughout my life and I would definitely say that Akshay stands out as unique. Akshay is clearly passionate about teaching and I would recommend him highly to anyone who is struggling or just looking to improve their score or medical knowledge.
