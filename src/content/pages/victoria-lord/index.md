# Meet Victoria Lord

PERSONAL STATEMENT

_"It has been incredibly rewarding to watch my students grow in their knowledge and confidence in test-taking skills during my years of teaching and tutoring. Medical examinations can be especially challenging given the many demands on students' time, so I strive to help students develop efficient study plans and increase their mastery in breaking down questions. I love learning each student's individual learning style and adapting study plans to fit their unique strengths and goals. I look forward to the chance to work with you!"_

I worked with Victoria for OBGYN shelf and really enjoyed my time with her. Through her sessions, I really became comfortable with the OBGYN shelf material. Shelf exams are extremely difficult, but Victoria not only ensures you have the content knowledge down, but she also makes sure you know how to approach questions properly. She also helped with recommendations of study tools as well that helped me prepare for exam.My score on the shelf was much higher and I believe that has to do with the tutoring I received from Victoria.
