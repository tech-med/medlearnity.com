### Application Editing

The AMCAS, AACOMAS, TMDSAS, and ERAS application is the first thing that the admissions committee will see. It should **highlight your accomplishments and experiences effectively**.

### Personal Statement Editing

Your personal statement is often the **deciding factor in getting an interview**. Craft it to connect with and move your audience. Make it compelling, and show why you will make a unique contribution to the field of medicine.
