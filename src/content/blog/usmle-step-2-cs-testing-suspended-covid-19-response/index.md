**USMLE Step 2 in COVID-19: Testing Suspension in Place Until May 31, 2020 & What This Means for Examinees**

For persons scheduled to take USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) through May 31, 2020, please note that all Clinical Skills Evaluation Collaboration (CSEC) Test Centers are closed temporarily. The USMLE has announced that they hope to resume operations of all centers on June 1, 2020 – though this is subject to change. The USMLE does not currently have an estimated timeline of when scheduling functionality on the Step 2 CS Calendar and Scheduling System will be restored. Please stay tuned for updates.

## **What This Means for Step 2 CS Examinees**

### Persons With Cancelled Appointments

USMLE will contact you by April 17, 2020 regarding further updates. Currently, all Step 2 CS testing has been suspended through May 31, 2020. If you had an appointment scheduled through May 31, 2020 - your appointment has been cancelled.

All examinees who were to test from March 16 through May 31, 2020, please don't worry! Such person will have their eligibility period automatically extended to March 31, 2020.

### Persons With Appointments Scheduled After the May 31 Suspension Period

If you had an appointment scheduled after May 31, 2020, you can cancel your appointment through the portal. You can reschedule it once the scheduling functionality is restored at a later date. As previously stated, the USMLE does not currently have an estimated timeline of when scheduling functionality on the Step 2 CS Calendar and Scheduling System will be restored. So tread lightly on canceling anything right now.

### Persons Who Recently Registered, But Didn't Schedule Appointment As Yet

If you have registered for USMLE Step 2 CS, but have not yet scheduled an appointment time, you will have to wait. You will be able to schedule an appointment once the scheduling functionality is restored.

### Persons Planning to Register

If you have not registered for USMLE Step 2 CS but were planning to do so, please note that the application processing and registration is still open. However, once your application is accepted, you can't schedule an appointment time until scheduling functionality is restored.

We recommend that you begin (or continue) the process of filling out your Step 2 CS registration application. But, don’t expect to be able to schedule an appointment slot until further notice.
