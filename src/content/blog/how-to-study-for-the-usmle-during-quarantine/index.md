Times are challenging. The pandemic has changed a lot – how we travel, shop, and socialize. But most of all, it has taught us that doctors and healthcare professionals are fundamental to the existence of the human race. There has never been a more urgent time to study medicine. But, the self-isolation measures we are all taking to flatten the curve may have left you wondering how to study for USMLE in quarantine.

We've got you covered at Medlearnity! Here's some guidance straight from our professional tutors who have scored in the top percentiles of medical school exams (260+ on USMLE):

## How to Study for USMLE in COVID-19

### 1\. Create a Routine

Every night before bed, make a to-do list for the next day. When you wake up the next morning, stick to that to-do list. Don’t falter from your routine.

### 2\. Set Up a Study Space

Set up a space for yourself that is designated as your “study space". You should go to that area of your home when you are ready to focus and study. Entering this space will put you in a focused mindset, and will tell your mind and body that this is where work gets done.

### 3\. Use Time Blocks to Break Up Your Day

Time blocks are a great way to organize your day. You need to set distinct blocks of time for studying various topics and also for breaks. Use activities like eating and stretching/indoor exercises to break up your day – and try to find a different space for each activity. Don’t eat in the same place that you study. And similarly, don’t exercise in the same place that you study.

### 4\. Limit Social Media

Scrolling through social media outlets like Facebook and Instagram are time sinks. Hours might go by before you realize that you have spent so much time doing absolutely nothing. Every day, set aside a block of time that you will dedicate to studying: say 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Also turn your phone off during this time. Stay true to not touching your phone during this time. Fight the urge – and you will see that the returns that you gain from deep focus will be enormous.

### 6\. Video Chat With Medical School Peers, Friends, and Family

Set up a Facetime or Skype/Zoom video conference with your medical school peers every week. Use this time to catch up and ask each other questions – like a virtual study group! You can even quiz each other on questions and concepts. Plus, Zoom let's you add as many people as you'd like and you can check it out [**for free**](https://zoom.us/signup#/signup).
