As a surgical resident, the American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam (ABSITE) is a crucial milestone in your training and career. The ABSITE is an annual in-training exam used to evaluate general surgery trainees, and it is usually taken at the end of your first and second years of general surgery residency. The ABSITE measures your knowledge and skills in general surgery, as well as your readiness for the board certification exam and practice.

The ABSITE is a comprehensive exam that covers a wide range of topics and objectives, including anatomy, physiology, pathology, surgical critical care, oncology, endocrine surgery, pediatric surgery, vascular surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, transplant surgery, plastic surgery, colorectal surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, pancreas surgery, breast surgery, endoscopy, laparoscopy, robotic surgery, surgical education, and surgical research.

It is worth noting that the highest yield surgical topics that can be expected to be found on the ABSITE include abdomen (including liver, pancreas, spleen, and biliary tract), alimentary tract (including stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anorectal), trauma, and surgical critical care.

These topics tend to be tested more frequently on the ABSITE and carry more weight in terms of your overall score. It is therefore important to focus your study efforts on these high yield topics, while also reviewing the other topics and objectives on the ABSITE. Clincial management is more commonly tested compared to basic science topics.

In terms of percentile requirements, it is common for surgical institutions to expect a score greater than the 50th percentile for their residents taking the ABSITE. Some institutions may have even higher expectations, requiring a score greater than the 75th or 90th percentile.

It is important to check with your program director or mentor about the specific percentile requirements for your program and the implications of your ABSITE performance for your trainee status and career advancement. Regardless of the percentile requirements, it is essential to strive for the best possible score on the ABSITE, as it is a significant predictor of your performance (particularly on the ABS qualifying examination, i.e., written boards). ABSITE scores are also utilized by fellowship directors in the application process.

To succeed in the ABSITE and surgical training, you need to have a solid foundation of knowledge and skills in the topics and objectives covered by the exam. Some topics on the ABSITE may be more challenging or unfamiliar to you, depending on your background, interests, or experience. It is important to identify your strengths and weaknesses, and focus on the areas that need improvement.

You may want to consult your mentors, peers, or other resources for guidance and feedback on your ABSITE preparation.

One way to improve your ABSITE performance is to learn on the job as a surgical resident. Learning on the job includes observing and participating in surgical cases and procedures, as well as receiving guidance and feedback from attending surgeons and other team members.

In the operating room, you can observe different surgical techniques and approaches, such as open, laparoscopic, robotic, or minimally invasive surgery. While managing patients, you can learn about surgical conditions, treatments, and outcomes, as well as the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management of patients.

You can also learn about complications and challenges of surgery, and how to recognize, prevent, and manage them. Reflecting on your learning and performance, and seeking feedback and guidance from mentors and peers, can also enhance your knowledge and skills.

Balancing your ABSITE preparation with other aspects of your training can be challenging, but it is essential for your success and well-being. Here are some tips for optimizing your ABSITE preparation and maintaining a balance in your surgical training:

- **Use the SCORE Curriculum**: The Surgical Online Core Curriculum (SCORE) is a comprehensive and evidence-based learning resource that covers the major topics and objectives of the ABSITE. You can use the SCORE Curriculum to guide your ABSITE preparation, and track your progress and performance. The SCORE Curriculum is available online, and it includes a variety of learning materials, such as lectures, case studies, simulations, and assessments. You can use the SCORE Curriculum to supplement your self-study and learning on the job, and to evaluate your knowledge and skills. It is important to note that the writers of the ABSITE utilize the SCORE curriculum directly to write the questions on the examination.
- **Set goals and priorities**: You may want to set specific and achievable goals for your ABSITE preparation, and prioritize your tasks and activities accordingly. You can use a calendar, planner, or other tool to schedule your ABSITE study time, and allocate your resources accordingly. You may also want to set personal and professional goals for your surgical training, and align them with your ABSITE preparation. By setting clear and realistic goals, you can stay focused and motivated, and avoid burnout or stress.
- **Seek support and resources**: You may want to seek support and resources from your mentors, peers, or other sources to help you prepare for the ABSITE. You can join a study group, review course, or online forum to share your knowledge and experiences, and get feedback and guidance from others. You can also use online or offline resources, such as question banks, mock exams, or study guides, to practice your test-taking skills and review key concepts. By seeking support and resources, you can expand your learning opportunities and network, and increase your chances of success.
- **Manage your time and stress**: You may want to manage your time and stress effectively to optimize your ABSITE preparation and well-being. You can use time-management strategies, such as setting deadlines, breaking tasks into smaller chunks, or using a Pomodoro technique, to maximize your productivity and efficiency. You can also use stress-management strategies, such as exercising, sleeping well, eating healthily, or practicing mindfulness, to maintain your physical and mental health. By managing your time and stress, you can balance your ABSITE preparation with other aspects of your training and life.
- **Celebrate your achievements**: You may want to celebrate your achievements, both big and small, to acknowledge your hard work and progress, and boost your confidence and motivation. You can use positive reinforcement, such as praising yourself, rewarding yourself, or sharing your achievements with others, to celebrate your ABSITE preparation and surgical training. By celebrating your achievements, you can maintain a positive and hopeful outlook, and enjoy the journey of learning and growth.
